INTRODUCTION ιι

the title-liber is quem ad nostrum Atticum de senectute mt'si-
mus. On the whole it seems most likely that Cicero intended
his essay to be known as the Cato maior de senectute, the full
title corresponding with Laelius de amicitehl. The word mae'm
was necessary to distinguish the book from Cicero’s eulogy of
the younger Cato (Uticensis) which seems to have gone by the
name of Cato simply².

ᾖ 3. The generalplon and purpose of the dialogrte.

The Cato maioris a popular essay in Ethics, applying the
principles of philosophy to the alleviation of one of life's chief
burdens, old age⁸. In ancient times, when philosophy formed

the real and only religion of the educated class, such themes
were deemed to afford a worthy employment for the pens even
of the greatest philosophers. Such essays formed the only sub-
stitute the ancients had for our Sermone There can he no
doubt of Cicero's sincerity when he says that the arguments he
sets forth in the treatise had given him real comfort⁴, and the
opening words of the dedication show that he meant and hoped
to administer the same comfort to his friend Atticus, who indeed
acknowledged the benefit he derived from the work⁶. When
Cicero wrote the treatise he was himself sixty-two years of age,
while his friend was three years older. Our author therefore
speaks rather euphemistically when he says that his purpose is
to lighten the trouble of an old age which is already close at
hand, or at all events approachingt

But in addition to the main ethical purpose, there waS, as is
the case in so many of Cicero’s works, a distinct political pur-
pose. He desired to stimulate in his readers an admiration for
what he regarded as the golden age of Roman politice, the era
