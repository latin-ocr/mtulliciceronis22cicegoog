quitur commem in victu, on which passage Kiihner quotes a fragm.
oi Varro—Persae propter exercitationes puerilis modt'cas eam sunt conse·

sians it is αἰσχρὸν pianr μεστούς φαίνεσθαι] Cf. also Liv. 34, 47, 5
mollioetflua'da corporo Callonem eatuli. 23, ιι corpora sicciora cornu.

regis: here=reg1o
fiahetmunera: see n. οιι ι9, l. ¹9·

¹4 ne sint: ‘grant that age has no strength’. This formula oi con·
cession sor argument's sake is frequentin Cicero, who often attaches to
it sane,· see my ιι. on Acad. ι, r05.

15 senectute=semtuu see ιι. on 26, l. 16,
legibus et institutis: ‘by statute and precedent'.

neither good nor bad health; the word takes its oolouring from the

¹ context.

quam...imbecillus: tor the separation ot quom from the adjective it
qualifies cf. ιι. on 15, 1. 3²·

ιι filius is qui: a pause must be made at filius ,· the sense is not ‘that
son of Africanus who adopted you', but ‘tlte son oi Africanus, 1 mean
