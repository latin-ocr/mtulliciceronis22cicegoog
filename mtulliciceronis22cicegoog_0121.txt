ἕ 36] NOTES. 117

alterum...rivitatis: ‘in him would have arisen a second star for our

. country ’. Hlud 'is really put for illc, by attraction to lumen-a kind of
attraction which rs exceedmgly common; cf. Roby §1068 and Fin. a, 70
Epicurus, hoc eninr vestrum lumen est, ‘Epicurus lor lre is your shining
light’; so Phil: 0,.44 Cn. Pompam, pund imperi populi Romani decus
ac lumen fiat, Lrvy 1, 39, 3 avords t e attracuon-lrunc lumen quon-
dam rebus nostn‘s fore. Cf. also 53, 1. 14 ea quae. As to lumen used
of persons, see my n. on pro Balbo 34.

25 quid mirram: n. on ra, 1. 26.

27 LaelietScipio: see non 4, l. 23.

eiusque...suntr ‘and its defects are to be made good by painstaking'.
Dr'ligentr'a scarcely corresponds to our ‘diligence’3 it rather implies rni-
nute patient attention.

28 pugnandum: est has to be supplied from the preceding sunt ; for its
omission cf. n. on 29, 1. ²3· The phrase pugnare cum senectute occurs
in Plin. Ep. 3, 1, 8. ”

tamquam...ric: so ut...sic a few lines farther on; also quari...sic in
26, 1. aa, where see n.

ἓ 86.

⁶19 habaida ratio valdudinis: ‘attention must be paid to health’; so
valetudini consulere (Fam. 16, 4, 3) operam dare (De Or. r, 265) in-
dulgere (Fam. 16, 18, 1) vacaneum curare often3 cf. also Fam. ro,
35, τ si salutr's omnium ac dtgvritatis rationem habueritis ; Fin. r, 64
Epicurus habeba ratiborem valetudinis.

30 ¹statuum: restrictive,=‘only so much’; so in 69, p. 54, l. 4, and
o ten.

31 potionis: the noun potus is rare before silver Latin. 'lhe texts of
Cic have it only once, in Div. 1, 6o potu atque pastu, where 1 would
read potione, which probably was changed under the influence of the
neighbouring pastu, Cic. sometimes has potatio in a concrete as well es
in an abstract sense. Cibus ct potio is the regular Latin equivalent for
our ‘food and drink'; see below, 46, l. 303 also Tusc. 5. 1005 Fin. 1,
373 Varro de re rust. 1, 1, 5.

adhibnrdum: it is not necessary to understand corpori (as all the
editors do) for though the construction adhibere alr'cua' or alicui rei ali-
quid is exceedingly common, the dative is often lest out, adhibere having
merely the sense of ‘to employ’ or ‘to use'. cf. eg. Fin. a, 64.

non: we should say ‘and not' or ‘but not’; the Latius however are
fond of asyndeton (called adversativum) when two clauses are con·
trasted. Cf. n. on 3, 1. 7.

3² menti atquc animo: properly mem is the intellect, strictly so called,
animus intellect and feeling combined, but the words are often very
loosely used. The two words constantly occur together in Latin3 Lu-
cletlusallen has mens aninai,· cf. also the passages referred to in n. ou
33 4 ’hau quoque nisi: ir. nisi eis.
