ιιι CATO MAIOR. [ἓ 56-

21 arcessebatur: as the verb precedes its subjects and the nearest subject
is singular the verb is allowed to be singulm had it stood after senes it
must almost necessarily bave been plural. Cf. lael. 14 cum et Philus
et Manilius adesset et alii plures; also n. on 7, p. 3²· 1. 5 above.

ιι aratores: literally ‘travellers', so ‘messengers’. They formed a
regularly organised corporation at Rome and were in attendance on
many of the magistrates. Those officers who had the fasces had also
lictors, who, however, generally remained in close attendanoe and were
not despatched on distant errands. The statement of Cic. in the text is
repeated almost verbatim by Plin. n.h. 18, ιι.

ι3ι ιιιίινωαὸίϊιίι ‘tobepitied’. The word does not quite answer to our
‘³4 t:¹¹13tcaesltiarsetinsupareFerrtplress'ion, found elsewhere only in Verr. 3, ιι6 ;
en no agorn e‘ a ers.

ι 5 haud seia au nulla: since haud scio an is affirmative in Cicero, not
negative as in some later writers, nulla must be read here, not ulla. Cf.
73, l. 16 haud scie an nulius Ennius, ‘probably Ennius speaks better’;
also 74, 1. ²5 incertum an liae ipsa die, ‘possibly today’.

officr'a: ‘in point of duty’, ‘if duty be considered'.

²7 quam dixit=dcquadixi, as in 53, l aar see n. on 14, 1. 16.

saturitate: the word is said to oocur nowhere else in Latin.

²9 ut...rcdeamus.· for the ellipse see n. on 52, p. 48, l. 1 ut...nascatis.

quidam: ic. the authors of the tertia vituperatio senectutis, whom
Cato refutes in ἐξ 39, 59.
³² so {tofos'ffls'iintffi ypspdsrppedpppd collecfively, as rosa often is;
33 ianr: ’‘firrther'.
succidiam alteram: ‘a second meat-supply’. The word seems to be

connected with caedo, and probably originally meant ‘slaughter’. In a
fragment of Cato preserved by Gellius 13, ι4, ιι (in some editions

ι 3, ι5, ιι) we find succidias humanas jacere. Varro r. r. ι, 14 has the
word in the sense of ‘meat’s

P. 50.

ι conditiora facit: ‘adds a aest to’3 cf. condita in ro, l. 27. Above we

have (56,1. ¹5) efficere nau iucundam senectutem ,· see ιι. on ι, p. 3ο, l 3.

supervacaneis operis: ‘by the use of spare time’3 literally ‘by means

of toils that are left over', ie. after completing the ordinary work of

the farm. Super-vacuus, which inferior mss sometimes give for ugan-
vacaneus, was not used by Cic.

3 oratinibus: cf. 59,l. 25 with n.

4 brevi pruecrdam: ‘l will out the matter short’. For praecidam (rc.
rem or urnsonem) cf. Acad. ι, 133 praecide (sc. serwsoucm); for bre-ei
