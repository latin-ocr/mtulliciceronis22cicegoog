habitus est, at revertenti a cena tibicine canente funale praeferretur. No
other instance is known where these particular distinctions were decreed3
the nearest parallel lies in the right accorded to Paulus Macedonicus and
to Pompeius to wear the triumphal toga pieta lor lise 011 each occasion oi
the ludi· lt may be conjectured that the music and the torch were part
oi the ceremony on the evening oi a triumph when the triumphator was
escorted home. cf. Florus 1, 18, ro (ed. Halm) Duillius, non contentus
unius diei triumpho, per vitam moreio ubi a cena rediret praelucere
funalia et praecinere sibi tibias iussit quasi cotidie triumpharet.
nullo exemplo: ‘without any precedent ’.

privatus: any person is privatm who is not actually in office at the
moment referred to, whether he has led a public lise or not.

, r 3 libentiae: a strong word is used to mark the heinousness of Duillius’
supposed offence against ancestral custom

15 sodalis: the sodalitates or sodalitia, brotherhoods for the perpetuation

oi certain sites, accompanied with leasting, were immemoris institutions
at Rome. The clause sodalitates...acceptis must nothe taken to mean
that Cicero supposed these brotherhoods to have been first instituted in
the time ol Cato; it is only introdueed to shew that Cato, so sar from
being averse to good living, assisted officially in the establishmentol new
clubs. Most of the sodalitates were closely connected with the genu all
members os a gens were sodales and met together to keep up the old
saera, bnt in historical times fictitious kinship largely took the place of
real kinship‚ and leasting became almost the sole salsum d’dtre of these
clubs. [See Mommsen's treatise De collegiisetsodaliciis Romanis] The
parallel ol the London City Companies will occur to every one. The
national sodalitates or priesthoods such as those ol the Sodales Titii.
Luperci, Augsestales etc. were somewhat different.

sodalitates autem : for the form of the parenthesis ci. 7, l. 24.

16 Magnae Matris: the image oi Cybele was brought to Rome in
204 nc. from Pessinus in Phrygia. See Liv. 29, ro. The Saera are
called Idaea from mount Ida in Phrygia, which was a great centre oi the
worship of Cybele. Acceptis, sc. in civitatem the worship oi strange

tate.
