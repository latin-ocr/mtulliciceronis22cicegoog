Δ vellem: sc, siposscm,· so in 3ι,1. ιι we find vallem equalem followed
by scd tamen as here, then in l. ι4 niallam. For instances of incomplete
conditional sentences, where the protasis is suppressed, cf. my n. on
Lael. 4, 1. 243 also see above, 24, l. ιι ιι. and below, 3ι,1. ιι; 33,

26 discebant...antiqui: doubts have been felt as to tbe genuineness of the
clause. In Tusc. 4, 3 a passage of Cato is quoted which refers ιο theuse
of the tibia among the ancient Romans; immediately afterwards the au-
tiquity of practice on the fides at Rome is mentioned, though not ex·
pressly on Cato’s authority. Τιιο words cannot be said to be unsuited
either ιο the person or to the occasion. -

discebant fidibus: the verb canere (which means ‘to play’ as well as
‘to sing ’) must be supplied 3 fidibus is then au ablative of the means or
instrument. There is e same ellipse of canere in the phrases docere
fidibus (Fam. 9, ιι, 3) and scire fidibus (Terence, Eunuchus 133l· Cf.

(οὑτοι, thymiam), and had better be translated here by ‘nor' rather
than by ‘not even! 'Ibe rendering ‘not even ’,though required bysome
passages, will often misrepresent the Latin; sor a striking example see

quarta restat causa etc. (like τόπος in Greek) is a rhetorical term

with a technical meaning. The pleader is to anticipate the arguments ·

he may find it necessary to use in different cases and is to arrange them
under certain headst each head is called a τόπος οι locus, literally mean·
ing the place where a pleader isto look for an argument when wanted.
Hence lom came to mean ‘a cut-anddried argument’ or ‘common-
place'. It is of exceedingly frequent occurrence in Cicero’s rhetorical
vntmgs.

aq nan plus quam: ‘any more than'. After the negative above (ne) it
is impossible to translate non by a negative in English, though the ’
repetition of the negative is common enough in latin (as indeed it is in
English dialects). Cf. ιι. on 24, l. 25.
