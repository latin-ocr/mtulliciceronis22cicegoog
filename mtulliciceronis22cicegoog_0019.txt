INTRODUCTION. ’ 15

ln 204 Cato began his political career with the quaestorship.

As he was of obscure origin and had small private means, it
was no small distinction that he had forced his way to office in

his thirtieth year. The lot assigned him as quaestor to Scipio,
then in Sicily and about to cross over into Africa The chance

was most unfortunate, if for no other reason, because Cato was
intimately connected with the party in the senate opposed to
Scipio, which had been attempting to bring him to trial for the
atrocities committed by the Roman army in southern Italy.
But in addition the two men were so utterly different that there .

was no possibility of the quaestor standing in the filial relation
to his consul, as old Roman custom required. As financial
officer, Cato complained os the luxury and extravagance which
Scipio allowed not only to himself but tobis army. Yet the
complaint was made not so much on economic as on moral
grounds. lt seemed to Cato that the old Roman discipline and
power to endure hardships were being swept away. The dispute
was ended by Scipio allowing Cato to return to Rome, some
authorities say from Sicily, others from Africa According to
orie writer² he came home via Sardinia and brought from there
with him Ennius the poetl.

ln 199 Cato was plebeian aedile, and exercised with severity
the police jurisdiction pertaining to that office, yet so as to win
popular approval, since he was chosen praetor for 198, without
the usual interval The province of Sardinia was entrusted to
him, and he strained every nerve to make his govemment
present as strong a contrast as possible with the lax and
corrupt administrationes the nobles who took Scipio for their
pattern. The troops were stemly disciplined and law-breakers
of every kind severely dealt with; in money matters the strictest
economy prevailed 3 all gifts from provincials to Roman officers
