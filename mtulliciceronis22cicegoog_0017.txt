lengthy discourse is the rule and the conversation merely comes
in by way of episode. But further it is highly probable that

Cicero owed to some particular Greek dialogue on Old Age the
general outline of the arguments he uses in the Cato maior.
Many of the Greek illustrative allusions most likely had the
