APPENDIX Α. ΟΝ THE TEXT. 169

it gives a most awkward and improbable model or instrumental ablative.
Scaliger's vs'etue ‘decayed' is feeble.
14 ettamen: some edd. give etiam; see my n.

16 septemdecim: Lm SbB septimo mnes with one οι two of the
seoondury uss· Seemyn.

17 duos: some edd. duo, here and in 30, 1. 32. 1 am convinced that
Cic. did not pse duo as the· accusative plural masculine form; it was
probably fore1gn to the ordinary prose of his time, eud had become
archmc and poetic.

¹9 et tanten sic: Sb most ueedlessly gives fieesse eum simt.

ιι similesque sunt: B brackets these words; cf. my n.

24 sanct: so all mss here and also below. The edd. change to facit iu

5 claris: I have struck out in which Mss and edd. give before claris.
The run of the sentence shews that virzi ought to be iu the same cou-
struction with senibus. In is easily inserted ; thus some mss of the
second class have it also before honeratis

15 hunc, num Homnum: L has huuc Homerum ,· the other uss insert
the words below, after Gorgian. The uss also give num before
Hesiodum end before Xenocraten ; after striking these out on my own
