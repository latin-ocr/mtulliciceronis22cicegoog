29 . sen'l...prose'nl: Ihave given the lineas Ribbeck prints it. He scans
it as a ‘baeeheus', consistrng ol four feet with the measurement ν--,

same line in Tusc. 1, 31 adding ut ait Statius (the word Statim how·
ever is not in the uss) in Synephebis, quid spectans uarietatem postera
saecla ad se pertinere? Saeclo= ‘generation', as in 54, l. 28.

30 Statim noster: ‘our lellowcountryman Statius ’. So Arch. rr Ennius
noster. Caecilius Statius, born among the Insubres, wrote latin come·
dies which were largely borrowed from the Greek ol Menander. The
original of the Synephebi was Menander’s Συνέφηβοι ‘young comrades’.

The asseveration is almost confined to comedy. The lines come from a

ppay by Statius called Plocium (τλοκίον ‘necklace'), copied from one by
enander with the same title. See Ribbeck’s ‘Fragmenta’
