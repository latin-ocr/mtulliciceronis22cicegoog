ADDENDA.

p. ⁸2, l. rr. There isa similar error in Liv. 38, ιι where two men
are mentioned as though they bad been consuls in the same year, where·
as they were consuls in different years.

tinguishes between munus and άιιιιιίι.

p. 125, n. on 5 ιι, l. 9. Llitjohann, Rhein. Mus. 1882 condemns a
great deal in the readings from here to the end of 5 45 all of which he
finds very disjointed. 1 cannot follow him. The story of T. Flami-
ninus, which he says is brought in abruptly, seems to me quite in place
as illustrating Cato's sentiments concerning pleasure.

p. 18⁷, m on 5 51, l. 32. vallo: Eiitjohann conj. munitam on the
ground that viriditatis cannot be the subject to munitur, because it has
flasseffiffif existence with the formation os the ear. The objection is
ΥΡΞ. 14⁰, nn. 0115 54. Liitjohann objects to a very great deal in the
passage from bere to the end of5 58. Ican only follow him so faras

to think the words in 5 56 sed ventb,..recedam very probably a gloss
made up from similar words in 5 45.

p. 1⁶³, 5 71, 1. ιι. si neat. et cocta decidunt: I am now convinced
that we should read either sed m. et c. decidunt ‘but when thoroughly
ripe they sall’, or (more probably) m. et c. dec. simply (with adversative
asyndeton). As the text is at present, we must understand si matura et
cocta evelluntur, which is absurd.

thrs work ιιι Bursian’s Jahresberrcht) proposes vivere videbamus, a
suggestion worth consideration.

Postscript: I r et that want os space compels me to iorego a dis·
cussion of the rea ings of that admirable scholar, C. F. W. Miller,
whose editiones the Cato maihr (in the Teubner series ol texts) has
appeared since the first ed. os this work.
