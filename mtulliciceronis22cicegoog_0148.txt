re regale: ‘worthy oi a king’; different from regium, which would
mean ‘actually characteristic oi kings'. Yet Cic. sometimes inter·
changes the words ; thus regalis potestas in Har. Resp. 54 is the same as
regia potestas in Phil. 1, 3.

Cyrum minorem: Cyrus the younger (cf. 79, 1. ao Cyrus maior), well
known from Xenophon’s Anabasr's. As Cyrus never arrived at the
throne (having been killed at Cunaxa in 40¹ in his attempt to onst his
brother the king with the help oi the ro‚ooo Greeks) regem is used in
the sense of ‘prince’‚ as iu Verr. 4, 61 and elsewhere; βασιλεὺς is used
in exactly the same way in a passage oi the Oeconomicus which comes a
little before the one Cic is here rendering (4, 16).

’ ro Lysander: the great commender who won the battle oi Aegospotamos

in 405 uc. against the Athenians.

ar venisset ad erem Sardis.- ‘had come to Sardis to visit him'.
aa celeret: n.0n3,l.6. ”

communem: some uss and editors have comem, which would have
exactly the same sense; see Appendix A.

²3 consaeptum agnem: ‘park’3 the phrase is a translation of Xenophon’s
repellerem this will account for the omission oi et before diligenter
comatum.

²4 dilegenter: ‘caresully’; seen. on 35, l. 27.

25 s tproceritates: the plural probably indicates the height of each kind
o ee.

ln the Roman army during a great part oi its history. The cause ior
this application ol the term is rather difficult to see; it originally meant
five-tweliths oi an uncia ; possibly it was thus applied because by draw-
ing lines between the points the letter V (five) might be produced. As
regards its application to treeS, see Verg. Georg. a, 277—284.

ab mbactam: see n. on 51, l. 25.
puram: so our sarmers talk oi ‘cleauing' the land.
