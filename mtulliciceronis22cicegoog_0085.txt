rr Salinatori: there can be no doubt that Cicero is guilty of a blunder
here, and in De Or. a, 273 where the story also occurs. Livy (27, 34, 7)
gives M. Livius Macatus as the name of the Roman commander who
held the citadel oi Tarentum while Hannibal was in session of the
town. Cicero probably found ὼε commander describedhsy the annalista
merely as M. Livius· (so in Livy 24, ao, 13; 26, 33, Ιι), and then

in 219, and subdued the Illyrians, bnt was condemned lor misappro-
priation ol public moneys, and went into exile. In aro he was induced
to retum by desire oi the senate. and in 207 became consul with
C. Claudius Nero, and defeated Hasdrubal in the great battle os the
Metaurus. ln 204 Livius was censor with Nero as his colleague, and
won his name Salinator by imposing a tax on salt. The title was
bestowed in ridicule, but clung to the family. Salinator was a relative
of M. Livius Macatus (Liv. 27, 34, 7).

ra r'ta dz'centi eta: the anecdote is told by Livy 27, 25, 5 and Plutarch
Fab. a 3 (who however refer the story not to the time at which Tarentum
ffssssetgi,but to the year after, when altercatione about it took place in

15 toga: here put sor ‘civil liie', the toga being replaced in time of war
by ὼε sagam. Cs. in Pisonem 73 paris est insigne et oti toga, contra
autem arma tumultus atque bella] De Or. 3, 167 ‘togam’ pro ‘pace’‚
‘arma’ ac ‘tela’ pro ‘bello’. We have the same opposition between
arma and toga irr Cicero's own much-derided verse, cedant arma togae,
concedat laurea laudi (defended by Cic. in Pis. l. 1. and off. 1, 77). Erat
is omittedas in 1. 25 and l. 28, also in61, l. 17,and assuntisin64,l. 153
such omissions are not uncommon in short emphatic clauses or sentences.

consul itemm eta: as the second consulship of Fabius was in 228
a.c., while the law oi Flaminius was passed in 232 (according to Poly·
hius), it is very difficult to understand the statement here made. Itis
possible that Flaminius was one of the commissioners sor executing his
own law, and that its execution lasted over the time oi Fabius' second
consulship. [C. F. Hermann in the ‘Rheinisches Museum’ for 1843,
p. 573 argues that Polybius only says that the Gallicus ager was divided
