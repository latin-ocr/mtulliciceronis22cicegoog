111 1 34.

6 ne...vindicare: ci. n. on 46, p. 45, 1.31.

7 in hac...cansumpsit: Cic. probably never used (as later writers did)

Curius: see n. on 15, p. 55,1. 6.

11 Curio: Plutarch, Cat. 1, says the ambassadors found him cookinga
dinner 01 herbs, and that Curius sent thern away with the remark that a
man who diued in that way had no need 01 gold. The present was not
brought as a bribe‚ since the incident took place after the war. Curius
had become patronus 01 the Samnites, and they were bringing the
customary offering 01 clientes ,⁶ see Rep. 3, 40.

surrounded by the Aequians, and ended the war in sixteen days 110111 his
appointment; also in 439 when Maelius was killed and Cincinnatus was
eighty years old. ln our passage Cic. seems to assume only oue dictator-
ship. The story 01 Cincinnatus at the plough is told in Livy 3, 16.

nominated by the consul 011 the advice 01 the senate.
