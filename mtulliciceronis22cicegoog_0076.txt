active service. Senem was commonly reckoned as beginning at 60 ς ο
but in ἓ 60 Cicero includes in senectus the aetas seniorum, and probably
intended to include it here. ln Tusc. 1, 34 Cic. reckons three ages
pueritie adulescentia emotus as here; below ιιι 74, four periods (or five).

effluxisset: the editors (so far es 1 have seen) account for the subjunc-
tive by the influence of posset in the next clause. This view seems mis-
taken: looking forward one would say fictura oetas cum effluxerit,
loolring backwurd praaerim aetas cum effluxisset whether the succeeding
clause contained a subjunctive or not Even with a succeeding indica·
tive clause cum effluxerat would rarely be found. It may be said that
posset is an effectuol bar to the rare indicative use; but it cannot be said
to be the cause of -the subjunctive effluxisset. The passage in 82, 1. 26
cum accessisset isprecisely similar.

5 cognomine: Cato borc- the title sepiem even in his liletime; see
lntrod p. aa. Cognomem is used in good Latin to· denote, both the
sbwnhamneloes.and the acquiredby·name; ιιι late Latin thrs latter rs denoted

in hoc sapiens: but above, 41. 19 rerum sapientiam not in rebem.
The genitive construction is not found with sopiens used as noun or ad-
jective till late Latin times.

6 naturam ducem eta: Cato’s claim to the title of sepiem does not rest
on any deep knowledge of philosophy, but on practical wisdom or
motherwit and experience of affairs. Cl. Lael. Coto (sc. cognomen
habebat sapientis) quia multarum retum usum habebat also ib. 19 los
viros bonos, ut habiti sunt, sic etiam appellandos putemur, quia socientur
moturum optimam bene vivendi ducem. In our passage Cicero hes put
into Cato’s mouth phrases borrowed lrom the Stoic philosophy, which
declared the lile of virtue to be lile iu accordance with nature lna·
{urae convem'emler vivere or ὁμολογουμένως τῇ φύσει ζῆν). Cl. 71,
