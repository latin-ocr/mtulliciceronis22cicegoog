0 Tite etc..· the lines are a quotation from the Annales of Q. Ennius
(bornat Rudiae in Calabria ²39 13.c., died 169), an epic poem in hexa-
meter verse (the first great Latin poem in that mette) celebrating the
achievements of the Roman nation from the time of Aeneas to the
poet’s oum days. The incident alluded to in Ennius’ verses is evi-
dently the same with that narrated by Livy 32, cc. 9, 10. Titus Quinc·
tius Flamininus, who commanded in 198 uc. the Roman army opposed
to Philip of Macedon, found the king strongly posted on the moun-
tains between Epirus and Thessaly. For forty days Flamininus lingered
hoping to find some path which would give him access to the enemy's
quarters. A shepherd who knew every nook of the mountains came before
the general and promised to lead the Roman soldiers to the ground
above Philip's camp. This was done and Flamininus drove the Mace-
donians into Thessaly. It is the shepherd who here addresses F lami-
ninus by his first name Titus. [The life of Flamininus by Plutarch is
simply entitled Piros] Cicero here' cleverly applies the lines to his life
long friend Titus Pomponius Atticus and he several times takes the
two words ‘0 Tite' to designate the whole treatise; cf. Att. 16,11, 3
⁴ 0 Tite’ tibi prodesse loetor.

quid: accusative of respector extent; so nibil in 30, p. 40, l.1;
alo'quidin82,1. ao; also 32, l. 12 mnu glorium.

adt'uero: for adiuvem, the long vowel having become short after the
falling out of the o between the two vowels. Catullus 66, 18 has

tuerint at the end of a pentameter verse, and the same scansion is found
in Plautus and Terence.

levasso: a form of levavero, which was originally Ieoouesos For the
formation of this class of future-perfects see Peile, Introduction to Greek
and Latin Etymology, p. 295, eu 23 also Roby, Grom. 1, p. 199, who

blas a list of examples; he supporta a different view from that given
a ove.
