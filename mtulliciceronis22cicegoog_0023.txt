INTRODUCTION. 19

against Asiagenus but against Africanus, who behaved with great
violence and arrogance. - ln the end Africanus withdrew to his

country estate, while his brother was condemned to pay a
heavy fine. A death-stroke had been given to the almost kingly
authority of Africanus, who never again showed his face in
Rome. Τ111 proceedings against the Scipios seem to have
begun in 187 and not to have been completed before 185.
Nearly twenty years 11αά passed since the conflict between
Cato and Scipio began and now it had ended in a complete
triumph for Cato ¹. But the new modes of which Scipio was the
chief patron were too strong to be conquered, and Cato spent
the rest of his lite in fighting a hopeless battle against them.
though he fought for a time with the strongest weapons that
the constitution supplied. ln 184 he was censor along with
Flaccus, who seems to have allowed his colleague full liberty
of action. Every portion of the censor’s duty was carried out
on the most severe and ‘old Roman' principles. Seven senators
were degraded‚ among thern L. Flamininus an eur-consul and
brother of the ‘liberator of the Hellenes' for serious mis-

conductl, also Manilius, an ex-praetor, for no worse offence
than that of having kissed his wife in presence os his daughter.
· M. Furius Purpurio, who had actually competed with Cato for
the censorsbip, was punished for diverting a public aqueduct for
his private advantage. Flaccus was named leader of the senate
in the place of Scipio Africanus, now dead.

On reviewing the equites, Cato removed from that body

review itself. With the ordinary citizens Cato dealt just as
harshly. ln his censorian edict he sharply reproved the ex-
travagance prevalent at private feasts. All articles of luxury
