Ρ. Decio: this is P. Decius Mus, who at the battle ol Sentinum in
²95 gave his life as a propitiatory offering ιο the powers oi the unseen
world, in order to bring victory to the Roman arms. His father had
sacrifieed himself in the same way at the battle os Veseris (close to
Vesuvius) in 340, fought against the Latius and Campanians.

owed its honour and splendour to nature, which principle was coveted
[οι its own sake, and was pnrsued ογ all the best men with a 'con-
temptforandn lect os pieasure'. In his philosophica] works Cicero
often confoundsekre Epicureans by quoting the action ol the Decii and
others like it, as shewing that pleasure is not the end os existence. ef.

tendum are technically used in Cicero's philosophical works to express
the Greek αἱρεῖσθαι οιρετὸν as applied to the fimi or τέλος, the supreme
