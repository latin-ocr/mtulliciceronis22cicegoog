§ ao] NOTES. 95

11 consilium: the repetition of consilium in adifferent sense from that
which it had in the sentence before seems to us awkward ; but many
such repetitions are found in Cicero. Consilium corresponds both to
‘counsel ’ and ‘council’ ; the senate was originally regium currilium, the
liring's body &dy-isere. Here translate summum cnsilium 'the supreme
eliberative y.

ra senatum: ‘assembly of elders’. cf. 56, 1. 17 senatores, &estem
Senatm implies alost verb rmd-rc, to be or grow old, from the stem of
which both send-tus and saw-ror are derived. This stem again implius
alost noun or adjective senus, old. The word senatus was collective,
like comitatus, a body of companions, mrim, a trained band, etc.

amplissimum: ‘most honourable’.

history, see my n. on Lael. 41, l. ιιι also below, 26, 1. 25.

externa: ‘the history of foreign peoples'; the opposite of domcstr'ca
(ra, l. 29) or nostra (82, l. 14).

15 adulescentibus: Cic. was possibly thinking, when he wrote this, of
Athens and Alcibiades.

labq'adoeas: observe that the verb labefacio is foreign to good prose,
in which labefacto is used.

mantelas: Cic. does not use metentur. In Mur. 3 ιιιιίίηιηᾰαῐε
followed by srutmtata in the same sentence.

ιγ cedo...cr'to: the line is of the kind called tetrameter iambic aceta-
lectic (or octonarius), and is scanned thus:

-cel-;'-‡'c-fl-‡'-.'.‡'e-,

[In all kinds of iambic verse the old Romans freely introduced spondees
where the Greeks used iambi; so in hexameters spondees for dactyls.
Ennius achieved more than one line, which, according to his own
principles, might be scanned either as a hexameter or as an iambic
trimeter; thus: cives Ronmm' tunc sunt jacti Campani]

cldo :=dic ,· generally derived from ce, the enclitic particle involved in
hr'c=(hi·ce) etc. and da—the root of do. So cette=ce·ddte=cedte, then
cette by assimilation of d to t. 'Ibe original meaning would thus be

‘give herc', and in this sense the word is often used. Dare is commonly
