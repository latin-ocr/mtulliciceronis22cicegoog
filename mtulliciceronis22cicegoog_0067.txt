plenus: final s was so lightly pronounced that the older poets felt
justified in neglecting it in their scansion. It was probably scarcely at
all pronounced by the less educated Romans, since it is often wholly
omitted in inscriptions and has been lost in modernItalian. Cicero
Orator 161 says that the neglect to pronounce final s is ‘somewhat
’ boorish’ (subrusticum), though formerly thought very refined (polibus).
Even Lucretius sometimes disregards itin his scansion. In the ordi-
nary literary Latin a large number of words have lost an original s;

e. g. all the nouns of the ·a declension. Cf. 14, l. 18 consectus.

fidei .· this form of the genitive of fides is found also in Plautus, Au-
lularia 575 and Lucretius 5, 101. Fidli as genitive seems only to occur
in late pects, but as dative it is found in a fragment of Ennius. Fidi
as genitive occurs in Horace and Ovid.

8 sollicitari eta: Cicero probably has not quoted the lineas Ennius
wrote it The word sic at least is evidently inserted on purpose to cor·
respond with ut before Flamininum.

noctesque diesque: the use of qumque for et...et is almost entirely
poetical, Sallust being the only prose writer of the best period 111 whose
works the usage is beyond doubt. Madvig still keeps noctesque diesque
with the Mss in Fin. r, 51 sollicitudines quibus eorum animi noctesque
diesque ereduntur, but condemns the reading in his note. Noctes is put
before dies bere and in cic. as above, also 111 noctes diesque (Verr. 5,
111); noctes et dies (Brut. 308 etc.); noctes ae dies (Arch. 19); 61. also
νύκτας τε καὶ ἦμαρ in Odyssey 1, 545, Iliad 5, 49o; Verg. Aen. 6, 117
noctes atque dees patet atri ianua Ditis ,· but the collocations dies noctes·
⁸que, dies et noctes are far commonet in Cicero; cf. also below, 81, 1. ao
labores diurnos noctumosque.

[Excunsus. Madvig, Emend. Liv. p. 487 n. (ed. 1), says that in

⁴ writers of Livy's time aud earlier, when an action is mentioned which
continues throughout a number of days and nights, either dies et noctes

and the like phrases are used or die et noete and the like but not dr'em
noctemque or diem et noctem, which expression, he says, would imply

that the action continued only throughout ene day and one night. Mad-

· vig refers to two passages of Cicero in which he says the reading is cor·
rupt: 111. Leg. agr. 1, 68 qui paulo onte elinn noctemque tribum'cium

noneen horrebant (where ,Zumpt wrongly says that only in this one place

do good mss* give diem noctemque); also Div. 1, 59 quari uero quic-

quam intersit mures diem norton ale'qeeid rodentes saeta un cribra corrose-

ο sent. In the latter passage recent editors still retain diem noctem. But
Madvig has overloo ed De Or. 1, 161 eandem incudem diem nectensque

tundentibus ; also three passages of Caesar: viz. Bell. Gall. 7, 41, 6 and

· §.sthnoylpplpisgyvboryum does often mean ‘throughout one day and
om night' (as eg. in Nep. Tbem. 8, 7) yet it would seem that the other
sense cannot be excluded, and very likely the uss readings should be

1, 1; to which add a passage in the Bell. Hisp.
