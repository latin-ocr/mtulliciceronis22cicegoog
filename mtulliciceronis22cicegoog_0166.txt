162 CATO MAIOR. · · [583-

98⁸·
²9 quidquod: ‘what of this, that...'; cl quid-quiin26,l.19; also ιι.

31 on tzalmam: this change isvery common; see my n. on Acad. r, 8ο.

3² nan vellere: either nrm uidere οι non item was necessary, as Cicero
does not generally eud sentences or clauses with nam· see my n. on Lael.

33 19, ιΙιΙιαιῗιι dilexi: so 26, l. 13 coluntur ct diliguntur.

P. aas

ι uc'zicndi: Cic. ior the most part avoids the genitive plural os the
gerundivc in agreement with a noun, and uses the gerund as here
Meissner notes that latin has no verb with the sense ‘to see again ',
which a modern would use here.

3 qua:=adqccos; see n. on ra, l. 31·

4 Pelaan: a mistake ol Cicero’s. It was not Pelias but hishallbrother
Aeson, father oi Iason, whom Medea made young again by cutting him
to pieces and boiling him in her enchanted cauldron. She induced,
however, the daughters oi Pelias to try the same experiment with their

father; the result of oourse, was very different. Plautus, Pseud. 3, a, 80
seems to make the same mistake.

ri quis deus: see u. on 40, l. 1⁹· The present subjunctive is notice·
able3 strictly, an impossible condition should require the past tense, but
in vividp es anim ossible condition is momentarily treated as
possible. So ic. gene ysayssc'revivc'scat aliquis, uot revivisceret.

6 decursospaca: ‘whenIhavcruumy race’. Seen. on14,l. 173
also on 33, p. 41,l. r. Lucretius 3, 1042 oddly has decursa lumine
uitae.

7 ad carceres a calce: carceres were the barriers behind which the horses
and cars stood waiting ior the race; calx (γραμμὴ), literally ‘a chalked
line ’, was what we should call ‘the winning-post’. Cl. Lael. 101
aptandum estut cum aequalibus posses, quibusnam tamquam ι carceribus
emissus sit, cum isdem ad calcem, ut dc'citur, peramica Tusc- 1, ι 5 nunc
ve'clco calcem adquam cum sitdecccrcum, nihil sit practerea extimescendum.

8 habeatsane: seen. on4, l. ²3·
9 satietatem...madum: see n. onl 13.

ιο multi et ei docti : as Nigelsbach, Stilistik 5 ι5, 5, remarks, Cic.
always uses this phrase and not multi docti. One of the books Cic. bas
