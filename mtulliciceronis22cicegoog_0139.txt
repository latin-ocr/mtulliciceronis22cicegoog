ἓ 50] NOTES.

oppressu} ‘surprised’.
33 multo ante: see ιι. on 6, l. 16.

§oo P. 4¹1.

ι mdis: the editors interpret acum studia to mean studia quac acumen
(keenness ol intellect) requirunt. But studium implies not intellectual
pualities but noral (ocal, enthusiasm‚ earnestuess‚ devotion), and 1 have
ound no passage where a purely intellectual attribute goes with the

word. Ibelieve Cicero wrote acribus; cf. De Or. r, 79 studium acer·
remum, ‘a mos. absorbing (or earnest) pursuit'. Cicero several times
has recta studia, i. e. real accompanied by moral earnestness.

ι Naevius: seen. on ao, l. 18.

Truculento...Preudolo.· these plays of Plautus (lived from 254 to
184 mc.) we still possess. The Truculentus is so named from one of the
characters, a slave ef savage disposition who is wheedled; the Pseudolus
from a cheating slave. The latter name is commonly supposed to be a
transcription from aGreek word ψευδυἊοι, which however never occurs;
and as the change from Greek u to latin o is not found before l, Corssen
assumes perdulce ω the original word. The form Pseudulus of the
name is probably later than Pseudolus.

3 Lebium: Livius Andronicus, the founder of Latin literature (lived
from about 285 to 204 mc), who translated the Odyssey‚ also many Greek
tragedies. Livius was a Greek captured by Livius Salinator at Taren·
tum in 275 B.0.; for ι time he was the slave of Livius, and, according
to custom, took his nane when set free. For an account of his writings
see Cruttwell's Hist. d Roman Literature ch. iii.

4 demersa: ‘bad brought on to the stage'. Docere (like διδάσκειν
in Greek, which bas the same use) meant, originally, to instruct the
performers in the play.

Centone Tradita carnalibus: i-e. in ²40 lac. The use of que
here is noticeable3 w a date is given by reference to the consuls of
the year ir is usual to insert et (not que or erpere, which rarely occur)

between the two names, if only the cognomina (as here) be given. If .

the full names bl given, then they are put side by side without et. Cf.
ιι. on ιο, p. 33, .2.

5 processit aetate: cf. ιι, l. 2611.

6 Crassi: see n. on ιγ, l. 7.

pontefici ct aeriis rierr's: the ius poietificr'um regarded mainly the proper
modes of conducting religious ceremonial. Ius civile, which is often
used to denote the whole body of Roman Law‚ here includes only the
secular portion of that Law. Cf. ιι. on 38, l. ²4· .

7 hammonis: ‘the present P.Scipio’. Soin14‚l.r1hicon·
sules ‘the present consuls'3 Re . r, 14 Africanus hic Pauli filius, and
often; cf. n. on 68, l. 30. e P. Scipio who is meant here is not
Africanus, but Nasica Corculum.
