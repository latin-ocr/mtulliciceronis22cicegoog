⁶4 caro aaron. [51-

retained in some of the passages of Livy which Madvig, in the note
above quoted, has judged to be corrupt] '

9 moderationem...aequitatem: ‘the selfcontrol and even balance of
your mind '. Moderatis is in Cic. a common translation of σωφρο-
σύνη. Aequitas is not bere used in its commonest sense of ‘reasonable-

' uess’ or ‘equity’, but as the noun corresponding to ansas in the ordinary
phrase aecus animus (Horace, ‘aecum memento rebus in arduis servare
nrmtem'); cs. Tusa r, 97 hanc maximi animi aequetatem in ipsa morte,
of Socrates' undisturbed composure y'ust before his execution.

animi tui: for the position of these words between moderationem and
aequitatem. to both of which nouus they refer (a form of speech called
by the Latin grammarians coniunctio) see my note on Laelius 8, l. aa
cum nemme' viri tum amin'sse'mc'‚· also cf. below, 45, l. ao coetu ami·
corum et semanimem 65, l. 29 et membres bonis et areima· also the pas·
sagea quoted in n. on 16, l. 9.

ro cognomen: ele. the name Atticm, which Cioero’s friend did not in·
herit, but adopted. For the word cognomen cf. n. on 5, l. 5 below.

deportasse: it should be noted that the verb &penore is nearly
always in the best writers used of bringing things from the provinces to
Italy or Rome, and not vice versa, the Romans using ‘down' of motion
towards the capital where we use ‘up'. ltalia deportare occurs in
Tacitus and late writers, but only in the sense of banishing aperson (cf.
Ann. 14, 45). So decedere de provincia is common, but not Roma de-
cedere. For the simple ablative Athenis see Roby‚ Gram. 5 1258.
As to the form deportasse, it may be remarked that Cic. in the vast
majority of instances uses the contracted and not the full forms of the
infinitives corresponding to persects in avi. So putassent in 4, l. 30.
[A full and useful collection of examples of this and similar con-
tractions will be found in Frohwein, Die Perfectbildungen auf ·vi bei
Cicero; Gera1874.]

huntanitatem: ‘culture'; rie. learning resulting in gentleness and
refinement of character.

ιι pmdentcam: φρὸνησιν or practica} wisdom. Corn. Nepos (or his
imitator) in his life of Atticus ry, 3 says of him princepum phdosophorum
anpancsstqeppynit praecepta ut tris ad vitam agmdam non ad ostenta-

Ι ἱειέιηι rebus: ie. the state of public affairs at the time; cf.
ntro .p. 10.

ra quibus meipsam: strictly speaking the construction is incorrect, since
nespicar commoveri must be su plied, and Cicero does not really mean to
say that he merely conjectures himself to be seriously affected hythe state
of public affairs3 ego ipse commoveor would have accurately expressed
his meaning. The accusative is due to the attraction of tc above. See
an excellent note of Madvig on Fin. a, 88, who quotes and examines
a number of similar attractions. A remarkable example not quoted by
Madvig isin Tusa 5, 63 poetam maginem, quam bonum, nihil ad rem
(for quam bonus sit). Cf. also n. on 26, l. r 5.
