only used in connexion with persons; ci. however below 44, p. 45, l. 4

ultro .· ‘unaslred’, ‘oi my own motion '. There is aeeierence to the

well known story, that whatever subject was discussed, Cato gave as his
opinion ‘utenda est Carthago'. See Introd. p. 11.

nescitum et diu: see n. on 9, l. 1ο diu multumque.
31 tueor.- ‘advocate’, ‘support’.

quas...nequirem: cf. 28, l. 15 quam si ipse exsequi nequeas. For
quae (which some texts have), and which is not exactly accommodated
to its antecedent, cs. my n. on 7, l. 25 quae, also on Lael. 14, l. 26.

32 lectulus: a couch usually stood in the Roman study‚ on which the
student reclined while reading, composing or dictating‚ or even writing.
(ΣΙ. De Or. 3, 17 in eom exedram venisse in qua Crassus lectulo posito
recubuisset, nemque cuns in cogitatione definiens esse sensisset, statim
recessisse... ; Suet. Aug. 78 lecticulo lucubratoria. [Surely in Suet. lecti-
culus lucubratorius should be read. lecticula is the diminutive oi
lectica, notos lectus]

a viventi: Madvig on Fin. r, 11 says that this depends on obrepat not
on intellegitur; it really depends on neither, but is a dative of respect
(commonly called datim commodi vel incommode- cf. n. on 4, l. 14
quibus). ‘As regards one who lives amid these pursuits and tasks. the
time when old age creeps on him is not perceived'. Cicero does not
substitute the dative ol the agent, alter a passive verb, ior the ablative
with ab: all those datives which might appear at first sight to be so
used are like the oue we have here; see Madvig, l.l.

obrepat: ef. 4,l. 30.

ita sensim etc. .· ‘so adually and imperceptibly does life wine, and
is not suddenly shatter , but flickers down wrth la se oi time¹. Sensim
sine sensu (observe the alliteration) is lilre mentes dementis in 16, l. 13,
where see n. Sensim must have meant at one time ‘perceptibly’ then
‘only just perceptibly'‚ then ‘gradually' and almost ‘imperceptibly’.

quod eam carere duunt: this is not strictly logical, being put for
quod earet (or rather careat) ut eluunt. cf. Roby 1746 and my n. on

Lael. 35, l. 18.
