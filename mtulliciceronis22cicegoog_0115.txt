4 Nestor: ag. in Iliad 1, 260 sq.; rr, 668 sq.

tertiam aetatem: ci. Iliad 1, 250 τῷ δ’ ἤδη δύο μὲν γενεαὶ μερόπων
ἀνθρώπων ’Betim olol π σθεν ἅμα τράφεν ἥδ’ ἐγένοντο Ἑν Πύλῳ
ἠγαθέῃ, μετὰ δὲ τριτάτοισιν ασσενς also Odyssey 3, 245 τρὶς γὰρ δή μιν
φασιν ἀνάξασθαι γένε’ ἀνδρῶν. Δ γενεὰ comprises 30 years, and Homer
simply means that Nestor's grandchildren had grown to be men at the
time of the Trojan war. Ovid misunderstood Homer and took γενεὰ
to cover roo years, in Metam. ιτ, 187 where Nestor says vixi annos bis
centum, nunc tertia vivitur aetas. Naevius or Laevius (Gell. 19, 7, 13)
called Nestor trisaeclisemx.

, 5 verapraedicans dc se .· ‘if he told the truth about himself ’.

6 nimis: ‘to any great extent '. Insolens does not correspond to our
‘insolent'3 it is almost the equivalent os ineptus, and has no harsher
meanrngthan ‘odd , ‘strange', ‘rn bad teste.

7 melle dulcior: Homer, Il. 1, ²4? τοῦ καὶ ἀπὸ γλώσσης μέλιτος γλυκίων

ρέεν αὐδή. In Or. 32 ‘Cio says o Xenophon (whom the Greeks called ’
Δττικὴ μέλιττα) that hrs aratro was melle deletor.

8 suavitatem: notice the change from dulcior, which seems to be made ,
ior the mere sake ol variety, since elsewhere (De Or.3, 161) Cicero
writes dulcitudo oratrbnir.

nullis...viribus: see n. on 3, l. 9.

dux illc: Agamemnon, who says to Nestor in Iliad ι, 370 ἦ μὴν αὕτ’
ἀγορῇ νικᾷς, γέρον, υἷας ’Δχαιῶν At γὰρ, Ζεῦ τε πάτερ rol Ἀθηναίη καὶ
Ἀπόλλον, Τοιοῦτοι δέκα μοι συμφράδμονες εἶεν Ἀχαιῶν, Τῷ κε τάχ’ ἠμύσειε
πόλις Πριάμοιο ἄνακτος, Χερσὶν ὑφ’ ἡμετέρῃσιν ἁλοῦσά τε περθομένη τε.

nmquam: ι’.ε. nowhere in Homer.

Aiacis: νῖν. Aiax Telamonius, who was the greatest Greek warrior
while Achilles sulked (Iliad a, 768). The genitive alter similis is the
rule in Cicero, though some examples ol the dative are found even with
names of persons: see Madv. on Fiu. 5, ra. The old canon (dating from
the later Latin grammarians) that similis with the genitive implies in-
ternal and with the dative extemal resemblance has no foundation in
fact.

ro quod...aca·derir: ‘and were this to happen to him '.
