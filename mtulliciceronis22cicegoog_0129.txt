in English by presents. Although these verbs ex ress circumstances

which continue (since the general effect of old age is ing described) yet

they are thrown into the past to suit the past tense dicebam or dixi which

T. Flaminini: see n.on1‚ l. 1.

ιο L. Flamininum: as praetor he commanded the fleet underhis brother
Titus during the Macedonian war3 in rpa Β. c. he was consul. Septem
annr‘s denotes seven complete years (c. n. on 19, l. 6), as Cato was
censor in 184. Α reference to Livy 39, 43, r will shew that Cicero
borrows his account of F lamininus' crime from the old annalist Vale·
rius Antias. Livy also quotes (39, 42, 7) an account of the matter
given by Cato himself in a speech, which is even more disgraceful to
Flamininus.
eicerem: the phrase commonly used is not eicere but mouere aliquem
sulatu- lllolare and nota (censoria) are technically used of degradation
or'disfranchisement inflicted by the censors.

rr suisset: the subjunctive should be carefully noted. There is no
necessity for it, and ficerat might be substituted for it without injuring
the sense, and indeed would bea more usual construction. The sole
cause of the subjunctive is the attraction of the neighbouring verb
eicerem An exactly similar passage is Acad. a, 9 mm eo Catulus et
Lucullus nosque insi postridie venissemus quam apeed Catulum fuisse·

rr cum essetconsul in Gallia: not‘when he was consul inGaul' but ‘when
he was in Gaul during his consulship’. Cum with 'the imperfect or
