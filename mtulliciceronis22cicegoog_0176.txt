gnathtemgm os Appius, not on his eorese'rvatmp The errors
appear to have ansen from the corruption of ammus mto dominus (a not
nnoommon error) in the us from whichL was copied. Isso, the opi·
nion to which Mommsen seems to incline, that P and L were copied
hom the same archetype, will not hold good. '

¹7 nemini mancipata: P and L, both have mnapata (an nn·Cicero·
nian word); L¹ has however neminem. The correction was first made
by Tischer, after Nonius.

rr monumenta: L monumento, which Mommsen strangely supporta

²4 augurium: so recent edd. with L; H after P augurum.

31 quas sir Sh and others with the inferior uss give quae π’ ,· Η with
Pquas si,- the reading of L isnot recorded. Quas isstrengthened by
28, l. 15 quam si epse exsequi nequeas.

33 ianr agere nen possem: Lhas agerem, leaving out non possem...acta
vita, a reading which Mommsen perverselysu ports, seeming to think
that agere means to plan, and not to curcua. gb includes uon possem,
leaving out the rest.

16 mutiquam: said to be an archaism in imitation oi Cato's style. lt
stands however in Att. 6, 9, 3 ς also ib. 9, ιο, 6 and Tim„ 11.

32 expeteretur: my em. ior Mss peteretur. Alter sponu the ex would
readily sall out, and Cic. almost constantly uses expetere not petere of
the ethicalfine's or ereremum bonum.

4 vinulentia: so P¹ L; H vinounna wrongly.
ια cereo: the em. oi Mommsen atter Manutius, for crebro or credo.
Cereres is used alone as a substantive in Off. 3, 80. Cl. Sen. Dial.
