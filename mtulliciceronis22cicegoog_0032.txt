28 INTROD [senon.

tobearchaismsare (1) the use of deponent participles 'as passives

in §§4‚ 74, 79, a thing common enough in Cicer0; (2) the occur-
rence of quasi=quem ad modum in §713 (3) mandaciter:
audacter in § 723 (4) of tuerentur sor intuerentur in § 773 (5) of
neutiquam in §42; (6) of the nominative of th'e gerund govern-
ing an accusative case in ξ 6. In every instance my notes will
supply a refutation of the allegation. That Cicero should attempt
to write in any style but his own is exceedingly improbable.
