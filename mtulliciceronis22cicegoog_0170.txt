166 APPENDIX Α. ΟΝ THE TEXT.

My text bas been formed after a careful weighing of all the evidence
accessible to me. It has unfortunately been impossible for me to examine
for myself the principal uss. ΤΙιε only uss readings which I have specially
mentionedin the following notes are those of P and L. The readings oi
llalm are denoted by H, those of Baiter (in the Ziirich edition of Cicero,
1863-4) by B, those of Lahmeyer (in his fourth edition, Leipzig, 1877)
by Lm, those of Sommerbrodt (in his eighth edition, Berlin, 1877) by
Sb. ln a certain number of passages 1 have adopted conjectures of my
own, which will be found pointed out below. In orthography my aim
has been to get as near as possible to the orthography of Cicero’s own
time, though with certain concessione to established prejudices. The read-
ings which 1 have selected for comment helow are principally those
which illustrate points of grammar, syntax or orthography.

§1-

ι si quid ego: so L with all other known MSS except P, which haste,
a reading which seems to me to have arisen from the t of quit (for
quid-a common variant) combined with the eof ego, and to have been
aided by the occurrence of te in the next line; also by Tite preceding.
Ennius frequently elides the ὅ in agas for the rhythm cf. Ann. aro (ed.

Vahlen) sed quid ego 1111 animo larnentorl also 318 sed quid ego haec

numero? ΗΒ Lme and Vahlen follow P.

3 praemi: uss premii or precii for pretii which Ennius cannot have ¹
written3 see my n.

§a

18S certo scio: so BLm with L; HSb follow P in writing certe scio. 1
ee my n.

3 (p. 30) omnis: I write with -is not ·es the accusative plural masc.
or fem. of nouus, or adjectives, or participles whose stem ends in -1’.
giiii} must have done so in the great majority of instanceS, ifnot

ss.

9 Cius: the word is omitted in P, while L has clius. F. Ritschl
in the Rhein. Mus. for 1842, pp. 193 sq., shewed that Aristo the Chian. ἓ
who was a Stoic (although not orthodox) cannot be meant. Aristo ol
Ceos was a Peripatetic. For the spelling Cius see note.

54.

26 aseipsi: so PL3 Hhas apsis with inferior mss. Cf.n.on4,l.26. ,

eis: the spelling iis commonly found in our texts was almost cer·
tainly not used by Cicero.
