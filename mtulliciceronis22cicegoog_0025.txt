¹the object ol which was to prevent the dissipation ol family pro
perty‚ and the lex Orchia, directed against extravagant expendi-
ture on feasts, also the lex Baebia de ambitu, the first serious ’

But the ideas of Cato prevailed, and a cruel policy carried out .
with needless brutality led to the extinction of Rome's greatest
