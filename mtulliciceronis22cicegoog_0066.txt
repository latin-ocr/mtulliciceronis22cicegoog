versut: we here have the original quantity of the vowel preserved
(as in ponebat below, 7ο, l. 8); the o in versat was originally as long as
the a in versas. Plautus has some parallels to this scansion (see Corssen,
Aussprache 11¹, 488), but it is rarely imitated by poets of the best period.
Horace, Odes 3, 16, 76, has ardt and Madvig may be right in taking
inm'tcit and other similar forms in Lucretius as proseuta though Munro
makes them persects (for inmovilem).

’ 3 praemi : the genitive in 1-7· stom nouns in ium only began to come
into use at the end of the Republic. '

4 isdem : Cicero may have written isdem or eisdem (two syllables), but
hedprobably did not write the form most commonly found in our texts,
us em.

5 Flamininum: T. Quinctius Flamininhs first served against Hannibal
during the Second Punic War. He was present at the capture os Ta-
rentum in ²09 ac, and in 208 was military tribune under Marcellus.
After being employed on minor business of state, he became quaestor in

For the rest of his life he was employed chiefly on diplomatis business
concerning Greece and the East. One of his embassies was to Prusias

‘ king ol Bithynia, to call on him to surrender Hannibal who was living
at his court in advanced old age; this led to Hannibal's suicide. Fla-
mininus was censorin 189 (see below 47,1. 74) and lived on till some
time after 167, in which year he became augur, but the date ol his death f,
is unknown. He was a man of brilliant ability both as general and as
diplomat, and also possessed much‘culture and was a great admirer or'
Greek literature. l

6 ille vir eta: i. e. the shepherd mentioned in n. on line 1. Livy 32,

rr, 4 says that Flamininus sent to the master ol the shepherd, Charopus ,
an E irote prime, to ask how far he might be tnrsted. Charopus repliedf⁴ ⁴
that hlamininus might trust him but had better keep a close watch on
the operatione himself. Plutarch simply says ’γνώστην rol βεβαιώτην ’
ἑαυτοῦ παρεῖχε Χάρωπα.

haud marna cum re: ‘of no great property’3 re=re familiari, as is
osten elsewhere the case both in verse and prose. Cf. pro Caelio 78
hominem sine re; also below, 77, l. 9 and 10, p. 33, 1. 7 rem=rem
publicam. Cum is literally ‘attended by’; it is alm0st superfluous here,
since vir haud mugeto re would have had just the same meaning. So
cum is often almost pleonastic in Lucretius, as in 1, 775 ito perfiere't ocri
cum fremitu ventus, where see Munro’s note. Madvig Gram. ἐξ 757, l
