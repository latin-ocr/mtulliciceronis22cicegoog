ιο INTRODUCTION.

in the work itself. In the dedicatoryintroduction Cicero speaks
of troubles weighing heavily on himself and Atticusl. Any
one who reads the letters to Atticus despatched in April 44 will
have little doubt that the troubles hinted at are the appre-
hensions as to the course Antonius would take, from whom
Cicero had something personally to fear. Atticus was using all
the influente he could bring to bear on Antonius in order to
secure Cicero’s safety3 hence Cicero's care to avoid in the
dedication all but the vaguest possible allusions to politics.
Had that introduction been written before Caesar's death, we
should have had plain allusion's (as in the prooemia of the
Academica, the De finibus, the Τ asculan desputatiom and the
De natura deorum) to Caesar's dictatorship¹.

The time was one of desperate gloom for Cicero. The
wound caused by his daughter's death³ was still unhealed‚ and
his brief outburst of joy over Caesar's end had been quickly
succeeded by disgust and alarm at the proceedings of Antonius.
It is easy to catch some echoes in the Cato maior of Cicero’s

’ grief at that time. When it is said that of all Cato's titles to

admiration none is higher than the fortitude he showed in bear·
ing the death of his son⁴, the writer is thinking of the struggle
he himself had been waging against a like sorrow for more than
a year past; and when Cato expresses his firm conviction that
he should meet his child beyond the gravei, we can see Cicero’s
own yearning for reunion with his deeply loved Tullia

§a The titleosthework.

There seems no doubt that Cicero himself meant the work
to bear the name Cato maior as its principal title. He twice
gives it this name⁰ ; in one of the passages⁷ he adds the descrip-
tive words (addressed to Atticus) qui est scn'ptus ad te de
senectute. In a third notice⁸ he gives the description without
