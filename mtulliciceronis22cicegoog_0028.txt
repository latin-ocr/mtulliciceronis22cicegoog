g bt. P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus the younger was no blood

relation of the conqueror of Zama, but the adopted son of
his son. lt must be remembered‚ however, that adoption was
much more formal and binding, and produced much closer
ties in ancient than in modern times. The elder Africanus
was unfortunate in his sons. The younger attained to the
praetorship in 174 but was immediately driven from the senate

in 148 he stood for the aedileship‚ but was elected consul for the
year 147 and again for 146, when he finished the war. He is said
to have grieved over the fate of Carthage, and to have dreaded
any further increase of the Roman territory. ln 142 Scipio
