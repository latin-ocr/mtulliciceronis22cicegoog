26 Q. Maximum: the famous Q. Fabius Maximus Verrucosus Ovicula
Cunctator, hero of the Second Punic War.

eum...recepit: this clause has often been suspected tc be an insertion
of the writers of ress. But (r) the capture of Tarentum iu ao9 n-c. was
Fabius' crowning achievement and ‘captor of Tarentum' was often
added to his name as a title of honour; see eg. De Or. a, 2733 and (a)
there were several other persons oi distinction bearing the name Q.
Maximus about the same time, so that some special mark was wanted
for the salre of clearness. Notice recepit ‘recovered'‚ Tarentum having
been lost by the Romam to Hannibal in ura lae.

27 snum adulescens: observe the emphasis given by placing close
together the two words of opposite meaning.

erat...gravitas: ‘that hero possessed dignity tempered by courtesy’.
Expressions like erat in illo gravitas are common in Cicero 3 ag. Mur.
58 erat in Cotta summa el muna. 'I'he metaphor incondita (‘seasoned')
is also common ; cf. La . 66 navius monem, haudquaquam mediocre
condimentum amicitiae.

a9 quamquam: ‘though indeed ’‚ introducing a necessary correction of
mummi& zeclsethns mares mmaverat. For this corrective quam-
. . , . .

clolere: ‘to revereuce’, ‘pay regard to'; so in 7, l. 293 26, l. 133
8³, · 33·

grandem natu: although the phrases maiar nummus paruus minor
minimus natu are of frequent occurrence, et magnus natu is not Latin,
grandir reatu being always used instead. u l. 4 (p. 33), and in 16, 1. 19
we have grandem without natu. The historicus use magno natu esse or
in magno natu esse sometimes.

30 anna post: the word unus ‘a not usually attached to annus except
where there is a strong contrast between one and a larger number
os years; cf. 24, l. ,²⁷¹ {nno past must not be translated ‘during the
{tutin liidie ..taffrt‘itft ‘iiii issigyffiiidii 3⁸2 {ii
end of a year’ (the ablative being one of limitation, and facerat being
equive-lent to factrus erat ‘had been elected’). So quinto anno below,
‘at the end ot* the fifth year ', i. e. ‘five years aster'.

³² adulescmtnlus miles: these words must not be rendered as though
adulescentulus were an epithet qualifying mr'les. (See n. on ar, 1. 30
