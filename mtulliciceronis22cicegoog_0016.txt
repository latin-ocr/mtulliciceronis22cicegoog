os the Punic wars, and to do so by making the contrast between
that age and his own appear as striking as possible„ A like

double purpose is apparent throughout the De republica, where
Africanus the younger is the chief personage, and in the treatise
‚ on Friendship, where Laelius is the central figure. For the
dialogue on Old Age Cicero selects as the principal speaker
M. Porcius Cato the Censor, sor two reasons; first because he
was renowned sor the vigour os mind and body he displayed in
advanced liie¹ ; secondly because in him were conspicuously ex-
hibited the serious simplicity, the unswerving adherence to prin-
ciple, the seli-sacrificing patriotism, which were the ideal Roman
virtues and which Cicero missed iu the politicians of his time

All Cicero's philosophical and rhetorical works were con-
fessedly founded more or less on Greek originals ln several ‘
passages oi the Coto maior he has clearly indicated the stores
on which he principally drew. Passages from Xenophou's
Oeconomicus and C yropaedio are translated in chapters 17 and
22. In chapters a, 3 we have a close imitation oi the conversa-
tion between Socrates and Cephalus at the outset of Plato’s
Republz’c, while in c. 21 one of the most striking parts oi the
’ Phaedo is reproduced. In AppendixB (at the end of this book)
these portions of Plato and Xenophon will be found side by side
with Cicero'simitations. The view oi the divine origin and divine

destiny of the human soul which is contained in the passage oi
the Phoedo is rendered by Cicero in many oi his works², and

was held by him with a quite religious fervour and sincerity.
But beyond these special debts, Cicero no doubt in writing
this dialogue was under obligations of a more general kind to
the Greeks. The form of the dialogue was Aristotelian, rather
than Platonic³; the quick interchange of question and answer
which more or less appears in all Plato's works is here avoided ;
