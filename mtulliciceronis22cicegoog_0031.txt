Cato takes in (b) is, briefly, this, that though age makes men
weaker, it makes them wiser, and if they were not there to
temper the headlong youth, states must go to tuin. instances
of busy age are quoted, and (ἐξ 21, 22) the special obJection that
old men have feeble memories is rebutted bythe remark that
this is due either to an original defect or to an insufficient
exercise ol the memory.

ln division (c) it is argued (1) that temperateness in early
lile will to 3 great extent save the bodily strength (2) that no

demands are made by the community· on old men's muscles
(3) that many cases of weaknoss are due to ill health (4) that

mstz’ci adulescentes meet with courage (5) that according to
his own belief, death is the gate to a never-ending life (6) that
like a well-bred guest at a banquet, the old man should con·
tentedly depart lrom lise when he has had his fill of it.

It has been unhesitatingly assumed by the editors that Cicero

attempted to give an antique colouring to the diction of his
treatise in order to remind readers of Cato’s own style. 'Itis
