butlons to the elucidation of the text. Two 1 have
found much more usesul than the rest, viz. the edition
ol Tischer (Halle, 1847), and the valuable and too
little known edition by Allen (Dublin, 1852). The

latter 1 have only been able to use while writing a

portion os the notes, My obligations to these and

other editors are acknowledged, each in its proper
place.
