queo: the verb queo is rarely found without a negative, possiem being

used in positive sentences ι ci· however Lael. 71, l. 25 habere se putant
quod...queant dicere, where see my note. Cicero never uses nequeo,
though he has the other persons os the present tense.

14 quidem: concessive: ‘though I bevenot indeed the strength I had '.
miles een: see ιο, l 32 ιι.

ι5 fuerim...eum depugnavi: the change from subjunctive to indicative
isworthyof notice. 'l'hesnbjunctive is due to the class-notion-‘strength
os the kind 1 had’-see Roby1680 sq. But the reference in the other
clauses is so purely to time that cum takes the indicative in spite os the
well-known tendency of Cicero to introduce the subjunctive construction
aster cum. Depugnavi=⁴fougbt the war out’, or ‘to the end ’; cf. 38,

enervavit: reservare is literally ‘to take out the sinews'; cs. the
expressions nervos elidere (Tusc. ι, ιγ) and mevos incidere (Acaderu 1,
35) both oi which are used in secondary or metaphorical senses.

non afflixit: ‘hus not prostrated '.

ιι quod merul: cf. Tusc 1, 52 praeceptum Apollinis quo monet ut se
quisque noscat. The editors rightly remark that while the words quod
monet, qne merul seem to a modern superfluous, it was rather unusual in
Latin to malre clauses depend directly on substantives. Such con-
structions are however not nearly so uncommon in Cicero as they are
osten supposed to be; see my n. on Academi, ιιο. For the sense of
the passage cf. Fin. 5, 3 veteris proverbi admonitu vivorum memini ;
Lael. 85 acta agimus,¹puod vetamurvetereproverbeo. The usual cou-
struction alter verbs o advising οι waruing is ut with subjunctive, but
even in Cicero and the other writers of the best period the infinitive
sometimes follows when (as here) the advice οι warning isgeneral and
not addressed to any particular person.

ιι esse: emphatic,=vivere,· see n. on ιι, l. ιγ.

ego vero etc. .· ⁴1 however would rather that my old age should be
