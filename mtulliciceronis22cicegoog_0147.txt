ιι talos...tesseras: tali, ‘knucklebones’, were oblong, and rounded at
the two ends3 the sides were numbered 1 and 6 (1 being opposite to 6),
3 and 4. Four tali were used at a time arrd they (like the tesserae) were
generally thrown from a box (statillus). The tesserae (ol which three
were used at a time) were cubes, with the sides numbered from r to 6 in
such a way that the numbers on two opposite sides always together
made 6. Α separate name was used by dicers ior almost every possible
throw oi the tesserae and tali. The two best known are canes, when all
the dice turned up with the same number uppermost3 and umus, when
they all shewed different numbers. The word alea was general; in iact=
it was applicable to games os chance of every kind. These games,
which were forbidden by many ineffectual laws (‘vetita legibus alea’)
were held to be permissible ior old mem see Mayor on Iuv. 14, 4.
