APPENDIX Α. ΟΝ THE TEXT. 167

²9 adeptam: so P, but L has adepti ; see my comment above

30· putassent: so L; P has patavium,- the contracted lorm is however

{mmensely the commonet in Cic. See my comment on ι, l. 10 depor-
asse.

ί (ρ. 31) quam si: so L P,B Sb Lm; H om. ri with P. The repetition
of the siis so Ciceronian that I follow L without hesitation.

a consolation: so some inferior MSS, but PL and others give coenomia,
which is favoured by Mommsen but not adopted by recent editors except
B. The context appears to me strongly to require that aetas should be
the subject of posset. The stulti fret because life has so short duration
Cato replies that no duration os lise would sosten a foolish disposition.

8 dcsm'ptae: BSb with L discn'ptae, which H favours in a sootnote;
see however my comment above.

ιι ferundum: Sb ferendum against MSS, also ingredimdum below, 6,
l. oa. The form serrandum seems to be supported by the texts of Nonius,
who quotes the passage. 1 strongly suspect Sb is right ; see my n· lass
are ntrrdt to be trusted sor such forms ; below, 17, l. oo L alone has
gem a.

§⁷-

24 querellis: this, not querelis (which some edd. still retain), is the
better spelling.

ιο t'stuc: B Sb istud with L only.

ιι sunt: omitted by H with all uss except L and one other. The verb
would not be left out by Cic in this position in the sentence. 'lhe
omission was probably due to the use of an abbreviation.

14 essemsaner this all iuss except L¹ have ignobilis, which was long
{Zoitia}u hgohestslee 11{ceadings of Lcame to light, seen to be an interpolation,

Athem'emis: after this all mss but L¹ and another have esses. Τὴε
quick succession of essern esses fuisses is very unlike Cicero.

e ιο.

ι8 gravitas: in place of this L has virtus gravis, while one inferior MS
has gravet virtus: hence Mommsen conjectures virtus, nec gravis satec-
tus. But a stronger contrast is evidently needed than that afforded by
virtus and comitas. Sb has vinulis gravitas, but the words cambato
condita virtuto codas havea quite un·Ciceronian ring3 and moreover
the Istatinity ol [ἐξ expression virtum gravetas in this connexion requires
proo.
