In 196 Cato was occupied with his canvass for the consul·
ship of the year 195, to which he was elected in company with
his friend Flaccus Cato was the first novus homo elected since
C. Flaminius, the consul of 217. Itis probable, though not
certain, that he paved the way to his election by carrying the
first of the leges Porciae, restricting the right of punishing
Roman citizens. During the whole ol his career Cato showed
a high sense of the importance of the individual civis Romanus.

One of the first official acts of the new consul was to deliver
a set speech to the people against a proposal to repeal the
Oppian law, passed twenty years before, the object of which
was to prevent lavish expenditure on dress and adornments,
particularly by women. We have a lively report of Cato's
speech from Livy’s pen, partly founded on the speech as ·
published by Cato himself ¹. The eamest pleading in favour of
simple manners and economy failed, after having almost caused
an open insurrection on the part of the women'.

The two new provinces in Spain, Hispania citerior and
ulterior, were still in a very unsettled state. The nearer pro-
vince was made a consular province and assigned to Cato; the
praetor who govemed the farther province was also placed
under Cato’s jurisdiction. Before leaving Rome Cato carried a
law for protecting the provincials from extortion. During the
whole of bis year of office he practised with the utmost
exactness his principles of purity simplicity and economy in
public affairs. He is said to have started from his house on
the joumey to Spain with only three servants, but when he got
as far as the forum, it struck him that such an attendance was
scarcely worthy of a Roman consul, so he purchased two more
slaves on the spot! In the same spirit, before returning, be
sold his horse that the state might not be at the expense
of transporting it to Italy. Cato was no less careful oi the
