been addressed to a particular person, Cicero must have written ne
requisieris. This subject has been thoroughly dealt with by Madvig
(Opusc. a, 105) who reduces the use oi the second person sing. pres. subj.
in a prohibition to a single instance so far aa Cicero is concemed, viz.
Att. 9, 18, 3 tu, Mum, inpuris, adum ne ugus. He rightly conjec-
tured that Cicero there was only applying to a particular case, without
alte' the tense, an old proverb which contained the command in a
gene form. Madvig might have proved his conjecture by a reference
to Lael 85 acta agimus quod vetamur vetere proverbio. Many oi
the sentences in good writers where direct prohibitione of the form nc
faahs seem at first sight to occur are really elliptic. This is the case
with a passage from Horace allowed by Madvig (and after him by
Roby) to iumish an example, viz. Sat. a, 5, 87 sive ego recte, seu
prave, hoc volui; ne sis patruus milri, where asterpravc there is an
ellipse olfeci, then neris is really in a clause depen ent on hoc dico or
something oi the lrind omitted: ‘my reason lor sa ' this is to prevent
you from laying ‘uncle‘ to me ’. 'Ihe same exp atlon is rightly ap-
plied by liennedy (Gram. 94 n, a h) to Horace Odes 4, 9, 1 ne forte
credas interitura quae etc, and ought to be applied to Plant. Most. 771 “
(quoted by Roby 1600 as irregular) and manp other passages. Indeed
it may be doubted whether a sure example o the formula ne sacrus can
be produced from any prose writer belore Velleius.

dum adsit, cum absit: as both dum and cum here have evidently
a temporal sense, the subjunctives seem due to the influence of the
other subjunctivae utare and requiras. The chiasmus in this part oi the
sentence should be noted; cs. ιι. on 3, l. 6. In the latter part ol the
sentence clrsbsmur is neglected3 ior this see n. on 26, l. 15. For requi·

r debent: ‘must'3 the meaning of debere in Cic. is generally much
stronger than our ‘ ought ’, by which the word is usually rendered.

adath: here and in l. a=vitac,· so in 5, l. 8, where see n.; Plautus
osten husin aetate with or without hominum=in vita (as in Trin. ι4);
Cic. uses agere aetatem=v2bere (Tusc. 5, 77 and often). Yet in 1. 5
aetas has its ordinary sense3 there is a similar change in 45, l. 17, where
see my n.

a euque: this isacommon way ol introducing with emphasis a fresh
epithet or predicate. Oiten idque (καὶ rotho) occurs, the pronoun being

then adver ially used, and not in agreement with the subject. Cf. non
