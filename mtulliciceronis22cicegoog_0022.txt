18 INTRODUCTIOM

From this time to his death, forty years later, Cato was the
leading figure on the stage of Roman politics. In season and
out of season he attached abuses or innovations in speeches
addressed to the senate, the people, or the courts. Soou after
his return from Thessaly he struck a beavy blow at the un·
republican honour-bunting among tbe magistrates, of which the
example bad been set by P. Scipio Africanus. Most provincial
govemors drove their subjects into war, sent lying despatches
home about their victories and claimed a triumph. ln 190
Cato attacked with success the proposal to grant a tn'umpb to
Q. Minucius Thermus, who had already triumphed over the
Spaniards as praetor, and after his consulship in 193 had fought
against the Ligurians. Cato's next victim was his former com-
mander M' Acilius Glabrio, who came forward at the same

. time with Cato, Marcellus (a son of the captor of Syracuse),
1„ Cornelius Scipio Nasica, T. Quinctius Flamininus (the con-
queror of Macedonia) and Cato’s friend 1„ Valerius Flaccus, as
candidate for the censorship of 189. Cato by bis violent speecbes
procured the trial of Glabrio for appropriating the plunder cap·
tured in Thessaly, and himself gave evidence conceming some
property which had disappeared Glabrio denounced Cato as
a perjurer, but yet retired from his candidature. On this
occasion Cato and Flaccus failed, Marcellus being elected as
plebeian and Flamininus as patrician censor.

In the next year (188) Cato acted in the senate with the
party which tried unsuccessfully to refuse the triumph to the
two consuls of 189, M. Fulvius Nobilior and Cn. Manlius Vulso,
the former of whom bad gained none but trifling advantages
over the Aetolians, while the latter bad disgraced the Roman
name by making war without authorisation upon the Gauls of
Asia Minor, and had also suffered a humiliating defeat from
some Thracian robber hands on his homeward march. Not
disheartened by their ill fortune, Cato and his friends determined
to strike at higher game. L. Scipio Asiagenus (not Asiaticus),
the brother of Africanus, was asserted in the senate to bave
appropriated 3000 talents of public money, when in command

against Antiochus· Legal proceedings were taken not only
