cnro MAIOR. [ι 44-

P. db.

r vituperatio: so in 39, l. 5. Note thechiasmrrs in vituperatis nullo-
summa laria· and cf. ιι. on 3, l. 6. Vituperatio here is not blame, but
that which deserves it; so laus ‘merit', as in Vergil's well-known words
primam nunti qui laude coronam.

3 exstructis: ‘gronning' as we say. Cf. Tuse. 5, 62 mensae conqurtitis·
simr's qouh's exstruebantur.

⁴ frequenlrlus: above, n on 38, 1. 30.
moditate: ⁴indigestion’.
5 insomniis: ‘sleeplcssness’; the singular insomnium occurs only once

ilutprose (Tac. Arm. ιι, 4). lnsomm'a, ae isonly found in poetry and
aeprose.

si.,.voluptati: ‘if we must allow some weight to pleasure’3 cf. Off. 1,
roo sin litfflfflm qui aliquid tribuat voluptati. The elaborate
chrosmus m sentence should be remarked (ιι. on 3, l. 6).

6 blanditiis: ‘allurements’; frequently used of pleosure, as in Fin. 1, 33

blanditiis praesentium voluptatum.
dimne: this word in Cic. very commonly means nothing more than
‘splendidly’, ‘extraordinarily’

7 escam malorum: ‘an euticement to evil' (esca=ed·ca, from the root of
erlo). Plato in the Timaeus 69 n (a dialogue translated into Latin by
Cicero, a fragment of whose translation is still preserved) has ἡδονήν
μέγιστον κακοῦ δέλεαρ. Cf. also Cic Hortensius fr. 76 (ed. Halm)

voluptates conpmisquae vere et graviter a Platone dictae sunt illecebrae csse
atque escae malonem.

9 modt'cis: observo that for the sake of variety Cic chooses this, not

moderatis, as the opposite of immoderatis. Trans. ‘a moderate amount
of goodfellowship’.

ιο devicerat: pluperfcct where a modem would incline to use a perfect ;
sec n. on 42, p. 44, l. r. For the word itself cf. n. on 32, l. 16 de-
pugnavi. The battle referred to is that of Mylae, fought in 2603 its
memory was perpetuated by the deckiug of the sorum with the rostra of
the captured ships3 the columna rostrata bore a long inscription,arestored

’ version of which still exists.

ιι cessa: so best spelt3 some good texts still print comm, but coena is
decidedly wrong, being based on the fiction that the Latin borrowed
the Greek word κοινή and turned it into coma

rr cereo funali .· ‘the torch-light’s for reading see Appendix A.

firmali: the funale was a torch composed of withs or twigs twisted
into a rope (fum’s) and dipped in pitch or oil.

sibi...mmpserat: Cic. seems to think that Duillius assumed these
honours on his own authority. This was probably not the case3 they
were most likely conferred on him by a vote of the comitia tm'buta. Cf.
Liv. epit. 17 C. Duillius primus omnium Romanorum ducum navalrh
victoriae duxit triumphum, ob qnam causam ei perpetuus quoque honos
