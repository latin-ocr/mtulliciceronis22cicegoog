absterserit is common: e. g. Tusc. 3, 43 luctum omnent munera. With
this statement of Cicero’s ¹concerning the effect the work had on himself

the action. Cf. Lael. 73 effieen aliquem consulem, ‘to carryt ough a
man's election as consul’ 3facere aliquem currulem being merely ‘to vote
lor a man's election to the consulship ’.

5 satis digne: ‘as she deserves', lit. ‘in a sufficiently worthy manner'.
Some editors have thought di superfluous, and wished to cast it out,
but we have satis digne elsew ere, as in Verr. r. r. 82 and post. red. in
Seru ¹93 el. also Sex. Rosc. 33 pro dignitate laudare satis commode.

eui quipareat: the editors all (so far as 1 have seen) account ior the
subjunctive by sa 'ng that this part of the sentence gives the reason lor
what precedes Fit will never be possible to praise philosophy as
she deserves, seeing that he who obeys her etc’). I cannot accept this
explanation, because it will not apply to many passages which exactly
correspond with this. Cui is, I think, simply connective=et ei and
pareatis in the subjunctive because ol possit, the whole from qui to
degere being really a conditional sentence ol irregular lorm. Just in the
same way in Tusc. 5, 118 qaae qui recordetur haud sane pmeulrem est ne
non mortem aut optandam aut certe non timendam putet (where quae is
merely connective=et ea), Cic. wrote qui recordetur not recordatur
because of the very indirect form ol the statement which follows. Had
that statement been put directly, thus, reortem sane aret optandam aut
certe non timeredam putabit, the indicative recordatur would certainly
have been written. Very similar are the circumstances in the following
passage: Div. 1, 127 qui enim teneat causas rerum suturamm, idem
neeesse estomnia teneat quae sutura sint. But Cicero osten allows the
relative clause to remain quite unaffected hythe form which the follow·

tive in the relative clause (as in N.D. r, 5) it is osten difficult, having
regard to the known variations in Cicero's usage, to decide between the
readings [See Madvig on Fin. a, 86.]
