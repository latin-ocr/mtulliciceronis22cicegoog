THE Cato maior belongs to the end of Cicero's life. From
the year 46 to his death in 42 uc„ he wrote incessantly on
philosophical and rhetorical subjects. ln literary work he sought
to find consolation at once for his grief at the downfall of the
old constitution, and for the deep pain he felt upon the loss of

perfect exactness the date at which the C ato maior was written.

Caesar, that is after the 15th of March in the year 44¹. Again‚
the Cato maioris mentioned as a recent work in three letters ad·
dressed by Cicero to Atticusf. The earliest of these letters was
written on or about the 12th of May, 44⁴. We shall hardly err
therefore if we assume that Cicero composed the Cato maior in
April of the year 44⁶. This agrees also with slight indications
