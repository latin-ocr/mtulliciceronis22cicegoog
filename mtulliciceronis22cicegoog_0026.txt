rival. Cato did not live to see the conclusion of the war; he
died in 149, at the age of 84 or 85 years, having retained his
mental and physical vigour to the last He had two sons, one
by his first wife, and one by his second wife, born when Cato
was 80 years of age The elder sou, to whom many of Cato’s
works were eddessen, died as praetor-elect, before his fatherl.
· The other was grandfather of Cato Uticensis

The literary activity of the old censor was great, though his
leisure was small ln Cicero's time a collection of 150 speeches
was still extant The titles of about 90 are still known to us,
and of some we possess a few fragments. Cato's greatest
work, however, was his Origines, the first real historical work
written in Latin. His predecessors had been merely compilers
of chronicles. The work was founded on laborious investiga·
tions, and comprised the history of Rome from the earliest
times to 150 B.C.'‚ as well as notices of the history of other
important Italian states. Further, Cato wrote of Agriculture,
to which he was enthusiastically devoted. We still have his De
re mattha, a collection of maxims loosely strung together. lle
also composed works on law ; a sort of educational encyclopaedia
for his son; and a collection of witty sayings (Δποφθέγματα)
drawn from Greek as wellas Roman sources.

Plutarch seems to have known a collected edition of the
pungent and proverbial utterances for which the censor was
famous, and for which (not for any knowledge of philosophy) he
received the title of sapr'ens (‘shrewd’) which he bore at the end
of his life This edition was however not compiled hy Cato
himself.

ln view of Cicero’s treatise, the Cato maior, it is necessary
to say something of Cato's relations with the Greeks and Greek
literature The ancients merely give us vague statements that
he only began to learn Greek ‘in his old age '. The expression
rnust be liberally interpreted if, as seems clear, the whole of his
writings showed the influence of Greek literature It is certain,
however, that he thoroughly detested the Greek nation Pliny
