was censor, and acted with almost Catonian severity. Elected
consul for 134, he captured Numantia in the following year.
While in camp he heard of and approved the death of Tiberius
Gracchus, to whom he was closely related This judgment
cost him the favour of the people, and when in 131 he desired
to conduct the war against Aristonicus, only two of the thirty-
five tribes voted for his appointment, In 129, after a violent Ι
scene in the senate where he had opposed the carrying out of
Ti. Gracchus' agrarian law, he was triumphantly escorted home
by a crowd, chiefly composed of ltalians whose interests had
been threatened by the lav. Next morning he was found dead
in his bed; and Carbo the democratic leader was suspected of
murder. ’
Whether the degree of intimacy between Cato and Scipio
which Cicero assumes ever existed or not, cannot be deter-
minedl. There was much in Scipio which would attract Cato.
Unlike the elder Africanus, he was severe and simple in his out·

ward life, and though alover of Greek and Greeks, yet attached θ >

to all that was best in the old Roman character and polity.
Th0ugh an opponent of revolution, he was far from being a
partisan of the oligarchy. Altogether, of all Romans, he most
nearly deserved the description ίἀνὴρ τετράγωνος ἄνευ ψόγου’, ‘a
man four-square without reproach’. In his De re publica,
Cicero points to Scipio as the ideal statesman, and often else-
where eulogises him as an almost perfect Roman

c. Gaius Laelius, born about 186, was Scipio's most dis·
tinguished officer before Carthage, and his most intimate friend
throughout life. The friendship of the two was one of the
most famous in antiquity, and is celebrated in Cicero's Laelius
de amicitia. Laelius was an able speaker, writer and soldier,
and devoted to Greek learning, particularly to the Stoic philo-
sophy. He is with Cicero the type of a man of culturel. He
too is one of the interlocutors in the De republica.
