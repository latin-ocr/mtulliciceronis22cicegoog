ich CATO MAIOR. [527-

Cicero aller quisquis, quicumque, ubi and the like unless iii oratio obliqua
or by the attraction os the indicative into the mood of a neighbouring
subjunctive, (a) agas would be doubly peculias aster quod est. See a
valuable note by Ktihner on Tusc. 1, rio. whose conclusions are entirely
confirmed by my own reading. Thus in De Or. 3. aci the clause
quibuscumque nabis uti velis is parallel with and influenced by the pre·
ending conditional clause ri verba mutaris. Examples oi subjunctivae
aller qui'cgmquc etc. from authors later than Cicero will be found in
Roby 171 .

pro virilia: ‘as your strength permits’; so the phrases pro virili
μῖκᾞὲαηοθς the word is used only oi speeches in some way
specially remarkable.

teia. ’

i analemptior: ‘more Piii²b¹⁶'·. Tor the meaning oi eminuere see
n. on 43, . 32. The passive participle has the sense ol an adjective m
iilis, like invictus and many others.

Milonis: the most famous of the Greek athletas. He lived at the
end of the sixth century inc. and the praises of his victories were sung
by Simonides. It was under his leadership that bis native city Croton,
in Magna Graecia, attacked and destroyed Sybaris. Many stories are
told by the ancients about his feats of strength (see ἕ 33). and about

disciple of Pythagoras.

3 illacrimans: beware os spelling lucrinus either with ch lorc cry sor i ;
commori as these spellings are in texts printed in Englarid‚ they are ut·
terly without justification. The y rests ori the absurd assumption that
the Latins borrowed their word lacrima straight from the Greek δάκρυ.

dixisse: things like dr'ci'tur dixisse are exceedingly rare in good
Latin. Cicero nearly always uses two different verbs ς ie. he says aiunt
dicere and the like. See my note ori Arch. ao.

at: there is an ellipse here such as ‘these young men's muscles are
powerful but...'. This elliptic use ol atis common in sudden excla-
mations of grief, annoyance‚ surprise etc.; cf. 49, l. ²4· ’

4 vero: this is common in emphatic replies, whether the reply convey

assent, or be as here, a retort. [The usage iseircellently illustrated in
Nigelsbach's stilistiks 197, a]

tam: sc. mortui sunt. -

nugator: Alleu: ‘Catoniana vox: Gell. ii, 8, 4’. Nugari=
ληρεῖν, ‘to trifle ’-
