a quid...senes: sc. tibi videntum ‘what do you think ol' old men as
lawyers nav* So without ellipse, Fam. 9, ur, 1 quid tibi ego in
eputulisuideor? Cf. quid qui ιιι 26, 1. ¹93 quidquod m 83, l. ²9·

4 studium et industrie: ‘earnestness and activity’; decidedly not a
case of hendiadys, as some editors make it. Cf. n on 15, p. 35, l. a.

neque ea solum: :ome ταῦτα μόνον, ‘and that not only'. For the
&dmg claris (uss and edd. in claris) see Appendix Α. See critical

5 mauram: this does not correspond to our ‘honoured’, but implius
that the persons have held high offices (honmes); ci 61, 1. ²3 senectus
immmapraesertin. Here translate ‘stateem’-

in vita...quieta: ‘iu an unofficial and retired life'. We have chi-
usmus here (see ιι. on 3, 1. 6) since privata is contrasted with honmatz's
and quieta with claris.

6 summam senectutem: Sophocles died at the age of 90 in 405 luc.
7 quodprmter studium: 'from his devotion to this occupation'.

8 filiis: except Plutarch (an seni sit gerenda respublica 3 ὑπὸ τῶν
υἱῶν) who probably follows Cicero’s words, all the authorities tell the
{tpry of the poet's eldest son Iophon only. The tale is full of improba·
iities.

9 rem: =rem familiarem as iu r, l. 6, where see n.

patrimus bonis interdici solet: ‘fathers are olten prevented from
man 'ng their property’. For the construction cl. the expression
inter icere alicui aqua et igni. Τὴε fragment ol the xn tables ,here
referred tois thus given in Dirksen's edition: sei souriosos auct proauos
(prodigum escit (erit) admeatorum rentiliomque (gentiliumque) eius potes-
inserted, ie. the agnates (male relatives whose kinship with the furiosus
is derived through males) and members ot his gens are to administer
his property. We still possess the {orm in which the judgment was
made by the praetor urbanus (Paulus, Sent· 3, 4· 7)= ‘quando tibi tua
bmta patema avitaque nequitia tua disperdis liberosque tuos ad eges·
tatem perducis, ob eam rem tibi ea re commerciaque interdico'.

ιο quasi demittentem: ‘dn ramppoeotma' says the author ol the anon-

ymous life of Sophocles. Cf. Xenophon Mem. r, n, 49 nord vium
ἐξεῖναι παρανοίας ἑλόντι καὶ τὸν πότερα δῆσαι.

ιι in manibus habebat: ‘had on hand’ i.e. in preparation. So ‚
l. ιι septimus mihi liber Originum estin manibm ; but est in mumius
in ru, 1. ¹5 has a different meaning.
