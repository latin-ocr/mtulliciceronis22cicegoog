ἓ 21] NOTES. 97

26 processisset: so 50, p. 47,1. 53 also aetate prouehi (ro, l. 30), progredi
(33, l. 33), also 70, l. ¹3 procedere without aetate. ΤΙιε ablativo is one of
‘respect'; see n. on 24, l. 25.

qui...solitum.· ‘that he often addressed as Lysimachus some one
who for all that was Aristides’. The direct object of salutare is omitted.
For qui=tametsi is cf. Att. r, 13, 3 nosmet ipsi, qui Lycurgei suisse-
mus, cotidie demitigomur,· De Or. 1, 82 nomque egomet qui sero ac
leviter Graecas litteras attigissem, tamen...; Lael. 7, l. 18, with my n.

Lysimachum: for ut L. or pro Lysimacho. So Arch. 19 Homerum
Chii suum vindicant (=ut suum or pro seco). Lysimachus was the

father of Aristides.

27 stent:=rrioont, asoften; so in 32, l. aa esse=oivere,· 54, l. a8suit
:atisin¹ 56, l. 175 60,1. 63 69, l. 33.

28 sepulcra legens: Cato was a great antiquarium cf. 38, l. aa. ’

quad aiunt.·=rd λεγόμενον, ‘as the common saying has it ⁹. See my
n. on Lael. 19, l. 16 ; cf. also 49, l. 26 utdicitur.

29 in mom redeo mortuorum: the genitive as with numini, recor-
dari etc. For the hrase cf. Verr. r, rao reditcc'et memoriam, iudices,
quae tetus istius sieri& also below, 59, l. 29 in gratiam reatin cum
voluptate. Here translate ‘I refresh my memory of the dead'.

30 quemquam sertem: it is true that the best writers do not use quis-
quam as an adjective, but there is no need to alter sctum into senum as
some editors do, since senem is a substitute for a clause cum serux esset
(see n. on 26, 1. aa senex); ‘I never heard that anybody because he was
an old man...’. Senes must be so taken in aa, l. a, since pontifices etc.
cannot stand as adjectives ; so also in 26, l. ra sopientes series,· 84, l. 18
nemo vir. Cf. n. on ro, l. 3² adulescentulus milea

3¹ oblitum: for the omission of esse cf. n. on aa, l. 13. ⁴
quae curant: ‘the things they have at heart ’.

P. 87.

ι vadimonio: 'their appointments to appear in court, the debts due to
them and the debts they owe ¹. When the hearing of asuit had to be
adjourned, the defendant was bound over either on his own recognisance

merely (pure) or along with sureties (vades) to appear in court on the 4

day appointed for the next hearing, a sum orsurus of money being for-
feited ιιι case of his non-appearance. 'Ibe engagement to appear was
technically called vadimuium when the defendant entered into the
engagement he was said uadimonium promittere ; if he kept the engage-
ment, u. obire or sistere ,· if he failed in it, v. deserere. The plural vaa'i-
monia is here used because a number of suits are meant3 the word con·

stituto is chosen as a more general term than mammea, and as referring
to the circumstances of both plaintiff and defendant. Strictly speaking
it is the presiding judge who vadimonia coustituit. On this account
vadimonia constituito should be translated as above ‘appointments’ and
not ‘bonu’ or ‘engagements to appear in court'.
