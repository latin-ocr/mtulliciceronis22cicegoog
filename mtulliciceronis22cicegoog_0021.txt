revenue than of the expenditure. He largely increased the pro-
ductiveness os the mines and other property belonging to the
state, and all goods captured from the enemy were sold lor the
benefit of the exchequer. On leaving the province Cato made
an unusually large gift to each soldier, saying that it was better·
sor all to bring home silver than sor a few to bring home gold.
The provincials were thoroughly content with their ruler and
ever at'ter looked on him as their best friend⁴ The army was
kept in the strictest discipline. Some disorderly conduct of the
equites was rebuked by Cato in a bitter harangue which he
afterwards published. Partly by craft, partly by good leader-
ship in the field, Cato broke the strength os the turbulent
natives and returned to enjoy a well-earned triumph¹. ln the
same year (194) a brilliant triumph was celebrated by Fla·
mininus

Scipio, probably uneasy at the great reputations quickly won
by Flamininus and Cato, secured his second consulship sor the
year 194 but failed to achieve anything remarkable. Cato pro-
bably spent the three years aiter his retum for the most part at
his Sabine farm. When the war against Antiochus broke out,
he took service along with his friend Flaccus on the staff
of the consul Glabriot, and by a difficult march over the
mountains broke in on the king's rear, and so was chiefly
instrumental in winning the great battle of Thermopylae, by
which Antiochus was driven out of Greece. Immediately after
the battle Cato returned home with despatches. We have dim
and uncertain ,information that he took the field once or twice
again, but his career as a soldier was practically ended.
