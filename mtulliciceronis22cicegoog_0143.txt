§sal NOTES· 1³9

martit: ‘springs up'. Exsistere in good Latin never has the mean·
ing of our ‘exist', i.e. ‘to be in existence’, but always means 'to come

into existence ².

¹4 articulos: ‘joints’3 cf. 51, l. 30 meloto gem'erelato. The word tam·
’ quom softens the metaphor in articuli, which properly would be used
only of the joints in the limbs of animale.

ea quoe: by attraction for id quod; see n. on 35, 1. 23. As regards

the whole phrase ea quae gemma dicitur: ‘ the so·called bud ’, see n. on ,

14, t 16. Cicero took the meaning ‘gem' or ‘jewel' to be the primary
sense of gemma and considered that the application to a bud was
, metaphorical. See the well-known passages, Orat. 81 and De Or.

3, Ι55·

16 gustatu: the word grata given here by some MSS, was probably
never used by Cic.

¹7 vestito pampinis .· ‘arrayed in the young foliage'.
nec...et: seen. on 51, 1. 19.

18 defendit: ‘keeps aloof’.

fructu...aspectu: ablatives of respect, like gratam above andum...
speeiein 57,l. 5. See n. on 24, l. 25. =

19 errius qualem: n. on 14, l. 19.

or capitum iugatio: ‘the linking together of their tops’3 ie. the uniting
of the tops of the stakes by crossstakes. So the editors; but Conington
on Verg. Georg. a, 355 seems to take capita of the top-foliage of the
vines, nn interpretation which is quite possible. Those editors are
certainly wrong who remove the comma after iugatio and place it after
religatio, as though et were omitted between the two words. In
enumeratione of more than two things Cic. either omits the copula
altogether or inserts it before each word after the first; but in
enumerating two things et cannot be omitted, except where there are
several sets or pairs of things Cf. n. on 13, p. 34, 1. 5.

religatio: ie. the tying down of shoots so as to cause them to
take root in the earth. Religatio seems to occur here only.

rs quom deiri: n.on14,l. 16.

²3 oleorum immissio: ‘the granting free scope to others’. Imme’ssio
scarcely occurs elsewhere in good Latin. The metaphor is from letting
loose the reins in driviug3 cf. Verg. Georg. a, 364 dum se loetusad ouras
palmes agit laris per parum immissusleabenis; Plin. n. h. 16, 141 cupres-
sus immittetur in perticas asseresque amputatione romorum; Varro r. r.
r, 31, 1 vitis immittitur ad uvas paneados. Allen and others, referring
to Columella de Arbor. c. 7, take the word to mean the setting in the
earth of a shoot in order that it may take root before being separated
from the parent stem. The context, however, is against this interpreta-
tion.

irrigationes eta: the plurals denote more markedly than singulare
would the repetition of the actions expressed by these words.
