APPENDIX A. ΟΝ THE TEXD 171

²5 seeuctute: my emtor uss and edd. senectutis. The whole context
seems to demand the alteration. Vetula iuvmtutr‘s are explained by
libide'rtose et intemperans adulescentes ; we cannot therefore understand
ur'tr'c smeetutr'r in the sense which the phrase has above, 27, l. ²9· and
below, 35, 1. co andll. 283 also 36, l. 53 55, l. 7. But there is no sense
ll&emhiltllt‘tltltntltzssntttt‘ {liminii}
mna nen e'n aetate ‚· also by the words above, orator metuo ne languescat
senectute.

, seems clearly an addition by a copyist who did not understand the
affirmative ne.

30 utrum.- P omits the word3 L has virum, some inferior uss igetur
utrum or utrum igetur,- some metune, which H adopts ; there is however
no point in saying that Milo carried a living ox, since the ox living would
weigh no more than if it were dead.

33' paulum.- L and ,some otherlnrss have paululum, but this diminutive,
like unquentum, rs doubtful rn the text of Cicero.

5 ( . 41) habet.- so I have written with two of the secondary ress.
Neither the consecutive nor the final ut seems in place here; with my
reading it stands (as commonly) lor exempli gretan. The neighboun'ng
debeas no doubt influenced the scribes in writing talen.

9 imbri: so L1 only; this form was probably alone used in the best
prosc ; cl. the exx. quoted by Neue 1² 235, 236.

14M ne sint.- so H B Lm Sb; P ne desint; L nen sunt, favoured by
ommsen.

ι 5 vires: ‘mitetur glossenea' says H, hut there is probably an intentional
cln'armus in passing from in senectute vires to vires a senectut .
