15 lta: =ea lege ‘on these conditions, viz. ...’, the clause with si being
an explanation of ita. This correspondence os ita...si is common in
Cicero 3 see n. on ra, l. 30 ita...quasa'. Here translate ‘age can only
be in honour is it fights sor itsels'.

16 se perag cs. Cic. Acad a, 36 veritas se ipsa defendet,· see also the n.
on 4, .a .

17 si nemini emamce‘ytata est: ‘ is it has passed into bondage to nobody’.

Mammium is a piece οῖ’ property3 emancipare is to pass a piece os
property out of its owner's hands. The word acquired two exactly
opposite meanings When used os a slave or a son in patria potestate
(who legally was subject to many of the same ordinances as a slave) it
means ‘to set srec’, unless, as in Fin. 1, a4 filium in adaptionem D.
Silana emancipesverat some person is mentioned to whom the original
owner makes over his rights. But in Plaut. Bacehid. 1, 1, 90 mulier,
tili me emancupa the sense is ‘I enslave myself to you ’‚ ie. ‘I pass my·
sels out of my own power into yours'. So in the wellknown passage
of Horace, Epod. 9, ra (os Antony) emaum'patus femmae ‘enslaved to
a woman'; cl. Cic. Phil. a, 51 venditum atque emancipatum tru'bu·
natum.

ad ultimum spiritum: so 27, 1. 8 usque ad extremum spiritum.

¹9 senile aliquid...aliquid adulescentes: chiasmus3 see n. on 3, l. 6.
For the sense cs. 33, p. 41, t 3 feracitas iuvenum...semctutr's maturitas.

ao quud qui sequitur: ‘and he who strives after this’‚ i-e. to combine
the vrrtues ps age'and youth. cf. hesch. Sept. 622 γέροντα. eleuata
6de δ’ altasar φυει. For quodque cf. n. ona, p. 30, lyraeque

arpatrme'lu' estlin manibus: ‘I have on hand', ‘am busy with¹. See the
noeonaa‚ .11.

Ortgr'num: as to Cato's literary labours see Introd. p. aa.

aa amnia college: Ihave no doubt that these words refer to the mate·
rials Cato was collecting sor his ‘Origines', though the commentators
here understand them to concern some other book of his, as the 'Arra-
φθέγματας see Introd. p. aa.
