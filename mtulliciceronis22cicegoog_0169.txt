Τ170 most elaborate critical edition of the Cato Maior is that by Halm
(in Vol. 1v. of the revision 01 Orelli’s edition of Cicero's works, continued
aster Orelli's death by Baiter and Halm), which is based on the readings of
seven 7755, with occasional references to five or six others. The best of
Halm’s 7755 15 one preserved at Paris, 01 the xth century, and marked by
him P. It contains readings inserted by a later hmd; the original readings
are denoted by P¹ and the later by P‚. This 775 ends with the words quin
ex in 5 78, the remainder being lost. Since the appearance 01 Halm's
edition Th. Mommsen has drawn attention (in the Monatsbericht of the
Berlin Academy for Jan. 7863) toa Leyden 775 01 the xth century, which
recent editors denote by L. Mommsen supposed that L had never before
been 00117100, but Lahmeyer afterwards discovered and published 700117-
tion made by Weber forty years since, which by some accident had not
seen the light before. Though our knowledge of L is still far from sufficient
to enable us to determine with perfect exactness its value, yet it is certain
that P and L are by far the best of the known 7155 01 the Cato Μαῖαν. L
as well as P hus readings from a second hand. There isa most striking
agreement between L¹ and P, and again between L² and Ρ,.
