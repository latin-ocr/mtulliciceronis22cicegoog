the first time, Carvilius having been consul for the first time in 2343
that as at that time the tribunes entered on office on Dec. roth and the
consuls not till Apr. 13th‚ Flaminius may have been tribune for
4 or 5 months while Carvilius was consul, and for 7 or 8 months while
Fabius was consul ; that Cicero, having read of carvilius· neutrality
aud Fabius' opposition, jumped to the conclusion that the two were
colleagues at the time, and so placed the law iu 228. The confusion no
doubt partly arose from the fact that both Fabius and Carvilius had the
cognomen Maximus] The Flaminius here mentioned is the same who fell
as consul in ary at the battle of lake Trasimenus He held large and
statesmanlike views on the policy of securing Italy by planting Romans

Sp. Carvalab patescente: this Sp. Carvilius was consul in ²34 when
he conquered the Corsicana and Sardinians. Iu 228 he was again consul,
and diedas augur in ara. He is said, but erroneously, to have been the
first Roman who divorced his wife. In 216, just after the battle of
Cannae, he made a most remarkable proposal, to fill up the gups which
that battle had made in the numbers of the senate by selectihg two
members from each of the Latin eommunities. It was almost the only
occasion iu the course of Roman history when anything lilre modern
representative government was advocated. Carvilius was not sprung
from one of the noble families who for the most part mono lised the
higher offices of state3 it is therefore not surprising that he ould have
sympathised with Flaminius.

Senatus auctoritas ia, strictly speaking, an opinion oi the senate not
formally embodied in a decree (senatusconsultum). Cicero, in Invent.
a, 52 says Flaminius carried his law contra voluntatem omnium
optimatium.

carm esset: ‘though he was'. What Fabius declared practically was
that the auspicata were a political instrument in the hands of the aris-
tocrats‚ rather than a part of religion. Fabius, according to Lir. 30,
²6, 7, was augur for 62 years before his death, and had no doubt had a
large experience in the manipulation of the ampa'czb for political pur·
poses. Compare with our passage Homer Iliad ra, 243 en oloris
