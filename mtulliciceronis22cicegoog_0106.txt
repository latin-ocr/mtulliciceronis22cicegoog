ιο eumpse: like s'pse end reapse (for which see my n. on Lael. 47) this
word contains the enclitic particle pe (probably another form oi que),
found in nem-pe, quis-piam etc. along with se, which belongs to an old
demonstrative pronoun once declined sos, sa, sum (the masc. and iem. of
which are seen in d, ἡ). The form was no doubt originally eumpsem,
like s'som (insum), but has passed into its present form just as ipsos
(nomi5 has become ipso, then epse. 'l'he only difference in sense between
eumpse and the simple eum is that the former is more emphatic. The
pronoun eumpse is the subiectos the infinitive sentire, but the substantive
to which the pronoun resen (senes) is not ex ressed. [Possibly Caecilius
