something of the great statesmen and generals of the time¹.
He seems to have received when young as thorough an educa·
tion as was possible without learning Greek, such an education
as ‘was only to be got in the capital He grew up to manhood
in the comparatively quiet time between the first and second

Punic wars; the most exciting event of his young years must
have been the destruction at Clastidium of the vast hordes of
Celts who had swept over the northern half of Italy, almost
within reach of Rome.

Cato was of the age for military service about the time of
the battle of lake Trasimenus, and entered the army then, as a
common soldier’l The first expedition in which he is definitely
said to have taken part is that of Q. Fabius Maximus Cunctator
against Hannibal in Campania, in 214⁸. This Roman com-
mander was a man entirely after Cato's heart, and became one
of his great models in public life.

Before and during the early years of his soldie1³s life, Cato
succeeded in winning some reputation as an orator, having
practised first in the provincial courts near his home, and after-
, wards at Rome⁴. This reputation as well as his great force of
character procured for him a powerful life-long friend and
patron, M. Valerius Flaccus, a statesman of the old Roman
conservative-democratic school of politics, the leader os which
was Fabius Cunctator. Through the influence of Flaccus, pos-
sibly with the aid of Fabius, Cato became military tribune, and
served with that rank under Marcellus in Sicily, under Fabius
again at the capture of Tarentum in 209⁶, and under C. Claudius
Nero at the battle of the Metaurus, where he contributed
materially to that great victory.
