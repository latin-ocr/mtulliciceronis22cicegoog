25 gremio: so Lucret. 1, ²50 paeane imbres ubi eas pater aether ln
gremium matn's terrai praecipitavi, imitated by Verg. Georg. a, 3² 5.
mollita ac mbacta: ie. by the plough. Subrgere (‘subdue’) is a

technicel word of agricultum so Verg. Georg. a, 50 scrobibus arbaco&
see also below 59, l. 26.

πό occaecatum: ‘hidden'. Caecus has the sense oi ‘unseen’as well as

that of ‘unseeing’ or ‘blind’.

l ²7 oecate'o: Cicero’s derivation, as well as Varro's, de re rust. 1, 31, 1,

from accidere (because the earth is cut up) is unsound. Ocea is rastrum,
frifflgdffi}‚it⁵ siarp points (root ak-; so Corssen); occatio therefore
28 smugpagmzheat'. This word has notin the best Latin the meaning ol
compressu: a word only found here in Cicero’s writings and else

where in Latin only in the ablative case, like so many other nouns
whose stem ends in -u.

diffundat et ela‘ei‘t: ‘expands and lures forth’.
herbescentem: this word occurs nowhere else in Latin.

l 29 fibris stirpium: so Tusc. 3, ι3 radiumfibrar.

γ 3ο geniculata: ‘knotted’. The verbgeniculaffromgenu)scarcelyoccurs

j

excepting in the passive participle, which is always used, as here, oi
planis.. So Plin. Nat. H1st. 16, 158 geniculata cetera gracilitas nadis·
que distincta (speaking of the hamando).

, 31 space .· besidesspica‚ the fonns spicum (which Cic. uses elsewhere) and

species are occasionally found. Spici here is explanatory of frugem.

3² valla: sor the metaphor compare N .Ι). a, 143 munitae sunt palpebrae
tamquam vallapilamem; Lucr. a, 537 elephantos, India quarum mi'le'bus
emultis valla mannitur eburna (where Munro seems to think, surely
without need, that some fable of an actual wall of ivory is alluded to).

ser.

33 quid ega...eammemarem: this and similar formulae ior passing to a
new subject are common ; cl. 33, l. 23 quia ega...praferam; 57, l. a
quea...dieam. Osten nam precedes the quid, asin Lael. ¹04· The ega
here is not otiose, as Allen says, but has some emphasis. Cato means
{hat his own devotion to viniculture was so well known as not to need
escription.

artus satus incrementa: ‘origin, cultivation and growth'. For the
omission os the copula see n. on 53, l. 21.

P. 48.

r ut: final, and slightly elliptic (Ἰ say this that etc.’); so in 6, l. 153
24, 1. υς 36, l. ²9³ 59, 1.17;82,1. 19. Similar slight ellipses with
ne are common, asin 46, l. 3ι where see n.
